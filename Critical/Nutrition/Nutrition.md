# Nutrition Therapy in Critically ill patients

1. ### Enternal Nutrition

ask what? why? who? when? How?

for patients who can't eat orally maybe due to impaired gag reflexes, weak jaw muscles, oral surgery, or for patient that can't get enough nutrients orally to meet his daily requirements

**indication of Enternal Feeding**

patients who is expected to be unable to meet his nutritional requirements orally or increase in metabolic demands e:g burns or trauma

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **absolute Contraindication for feeding:**
> 1. shocked patient -> so assess blood pressure before feeding
> 2. intestinal ischemia and obstruction

**relative contraindications:**

1. **severe hemorrhagic pancreatitis**: Malnutrition in pancreatitis can arise from decreased oral intake as a result of <mark>anorexia, abdominal pain, vomiting, ileus, gastroparesis, gastric outlet obstruction, and inappropriate fasting for pancreatic rest</mark>. In addition, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction leads to <mark>maldigestion</mark> of nutrients and may persist up to 6-18 mo after acute attack

2. **Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)** is a life-threatening illness almost exclusively affecting neonates with a mortality rate as high as 50 percent. The pathophysiology of NEC is inflammation of the intestine leading to bacterial invasion causing cellular damage and cellular death and necrosis of the colon and intestine. As NEC progresses, it can lead to intestinal perforation causing peritonitis, sepsis, and death. Signs and symptoms of NEC are non-specific and may include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, abdominal tenderness.

3. **others**: prolonged ileus, severe diarrhea, vomiting and enteric fistula

> [!NOTE]
> all these relative contraindications can be resolved then we will initiate Enternal feeding

> [!NOTE]
> feeding tubes that made of polyvinyl chloride must be changed every <mark>2 weeks</mark>

> tube size must be between 12 - 14, small size is more comfy to patients and less likely to produce sinusitis but is more susceptible to clogging

> if you will only do lavage to the patient, you can use bigger size

> if you will use silcon or rubber tube (which is preferred over polyvinyl) you can use <mark>stylets</mark> to harden the tube so you can insert it easily or put it inside the freezer

### Types of feeding

1. **Bolus feeding**: only with intact gag reflex and normal gastric function, it's when you give for example 200ml of juice each 2 hours over 5 - 20 minutes by gravity

2. **Intermittent feeding**: when patients can't tolerate Bolus feeding (e:g vomiting, high GRV) we give feeding in a way that is continously delivering small amount of feeding over a period of time for example: 200 ml over 30 min every 4 hours. you prepare the feeding and put it in a bag (as NS fluid bag for example) and through some device that is similar to the iv set you conncet the feeding bag to the Gastric tube to deliver the feeding over the preset period of time

3. **continuous feeding**: it is like intermittent but instead of over 30 min to 1 hour, it's given <mark>over 24 hours</mark>

4. **Cyclic feeding**: it is given at a faster rate over a shorter period of time
