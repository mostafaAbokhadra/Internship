# Nutrition Therapy in Critically ill patients

1. ### Enternal Nutrition

ask what? why? who? when? How?

for patients who can't eat orally maybe due to impaired gag reflexes, weak jaw muscles, oral surgery, or for patient that can't get enough nutrients orally to meet his daily requirements

**indication of Enternal Feeding**

patients who is expected to be unable to meet his nutritional requirements orally or increase in metabolic demands e:g burns or trauma

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **absolute Contraindication for feeding:**
> shocked patient -> so assess blood pressure before feeding
> intestinal ischemia and obstruction

**relative contraindications:**

1. **severe hemorrhagic pancreatitis**: Malnutrition in pancreatitis can arise from decreased oral intake as a result of <mark>anorexia, abdominal pain, vomiting, ileus, gastroparesis, gastric outlet obstruction, and inappropriate fasting for pancreatic rest</mark>. In addition, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction leads to <mark>maldigestion</mark> of nutrients and may persist up to 6-18 mo after acute attack

2. **Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)** is a life-threatening illness almost exclusively affecting neonates with a mortality rate as high as 50 percent. The pathophysiology of NEC is inflammation of the intestine leading to bacterial invasion causing cellular damage and cellular death and necrosis of the colon and intestine. As NEC progresses, it can lead to intestinal perforation causing peritonitis, sepsis, and death. Signs and symptoms of NEC are non-specific and may include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, abdominal tenderness.

3. others: prolonged ileus, severe diarrhea, vomiting and enteric fistula

> [!NOTE]
> all these relative contraindications can be resolved then we will initiate Enternal feeding
