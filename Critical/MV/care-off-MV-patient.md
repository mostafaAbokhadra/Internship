# care of mechanically ventilated patients

[amazing reference to increase your knowledge](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10421733/)

### initial safety checks
- observe patient, tube, MV and circuit
- observe chest rising and falling, auscultate air entry, ensure fixation of tube, observe patient color e:g flushed or cyanosed
- v/s esp. pulse and BP
- LOC fluctuate -> may be hypoxic -> do suction
- fast access to MRB, suction unit and catheters, intubation equipments (in case of exutabation occur esp. in risky patient e:g agitated)
- adjust MV setting e:i alarm limits e:g when HR exceeds 110 the alarm shouts

### Routine care of MV patients
- patient and family
- tube (airway)
- MV itself

### for patient and family
- **assess** from head to toe, focus on respiratory and circulatory
- **oral care** -> to prevent pnuemonia (VAP)
- **eye care** -> blinking refelexes are impaired due to low LOC , close his eyes after care becaues it's sensetive to bacteria and infection
- **nutrition** esp. proteins, becarful of high carbs because it produce CO2, ensure enough water intake to prevent dryness
- **skin care**: prevent pressure ulcers that may results from sedation and prolonged immobility
positioning unless contraindicated, air matress, moisture the skin using creams
- **sleep promotion**, decrease interuption of sleep for interventions
- **communication** board contains common ADLS tasks so patinet can point to it e:g patient points at positioning photo on the board indicating that he wants you to put him on that position
- **pain management**: continuous assessment using NON verbal pain scale, consider his complaint and consult doctor for analgesics
> [!IMPORTANT]
> chest pain can hinder patient from breathing normally
- **family care**: teaching about MV, weaning and it's consequences
> [!NOTE]
> usually MV is disconnected after 8 hours from surgeries

## troubleShooting when vent is continously alarming w/o obvious reason 
**think**
1. machine
2. patient
3. tube

#### steps when troubleshooting

1. call for help
2. disconnect patient from MV
3. hyperventilation using 100% by MRB, if patient is easily ventilated and o2 sat is going back up to normal then usually the problem is in the machine, if pateint is still uncomfy consider that it may be a patient problem not machine
4. patency of tube: is it obstructed? does suction catheter insert to the end ?
5. does ABG interpretation indicate other problem?
6. X-ray -> can indicates pnuemothorax or tension ....

# vent alarms

1. ### MV inoperative
- ventilator is not woking

    **action**: manually ventilate patient untill new ventilator is set up or some one is trying to fix the broken vent

2. ### low pressure alarm, low PEEP/CPAP , low exhaled volume
- patient is leaking some inspired air

    **assess all of the following**

        - is something disconnected ?
        - airflow is inadequate?
        - ETT cuff leak? 

    **action**: manually ventialte patient untill leaking is resolved

3. ### high pressure alarm
- PIP reached limits
- something is obstructed

    **assess the following**

        - secretions in tube ? -> suction
        - bitting tube ? -> OPA may be neccessary
        - water accumulate in circuit ? -> drain the water on a basket
        - decrease lung compliance e:g ARDS and pulmonary edema? -> use high PEEP and monitor it's complicatin e:g hypotension
        - kinked tubes ? -> fix it

4. ### apnea alarm
- occurs in spantaneous modes e:g cpap
- patient doesn't take breating spantaneously

    **action**: encourage patient to breath or give single breath, rate may should be increased

5. ### increased minute or tidal volume
- patient is breating more spantaneously breathing
- or may be due to hypoxia
- or increased lung compliance (patient is getting better)

    **action:** check RR and evaluate ABG, ETCO2 and patient improvement

> [!NOTE]
> - ETCO2 (End-tidal carbon dioxide) is the level of carbon dioxide that is released at the end of an exhaled breath 
> - it reflects the adequacy with which carbon dioxide (CO2) is carried in the blood back to the lungs and exhaled.
> - it can provide an indication of cardiac output and pulmonary blood flow
> - measured using capnometry or capnography
> - Capnometry provides a numerical value for ETCO2. In contrast, capnography delivers a more comprehensive measurement that is displayed in both graphical (waveform) and numerical form.
> - capnography is more widely used

6. ### change in RR
- may be due to hypoxia or hypercarbia
- increased metabolic demand (catabolc state, stress, pain, healing)

    **action**: obtain ABG and interprate, check RR and ETCO2

### complicatoin of MV

1. **patient ventilator dyssynchrony**
    - patient is fighting the MV
        **action:**
        - comfort patient, put on sedation
        - consider changing mode as appropriate
2. **MV induced lung injury**
    - **barotrauma**
        - due to high pressure
    - **volutrauma**
        - due to high tidal volume
    - **atelectrauma**
        - due to repeating opening and closing of alveoli (shearing forces)
    - **biotrauma**
        - Biotrauma is the release of chemical mediators caused by overstretching, shearing, or excessive inspiratory pressures during mechanical ventilation. <mark>it can lead to ARDS</mark>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Revise ARDS

3. ### Vap
- due to colonization of the oropharynx
- vap occur after 48-72 hrs of itubation

**bundle**

- elevate head of bed 30-45 degree
- daily sedation vacation to assess readiness to wean
- oral hygeine with or without (chlorhexidine) 12% Q6hrs with or without toothburshing Q12hrs
- hand hygeine prior to touching any ventrilator tubing or patient mouth
- subglotic aspiration
- cuff pressure maintaince
- pressure ulcer prophylaxis (prevent aspiration of acid)
- DVT propylaxis
prevent tube obstruction

4. ### Cardio compormis
    - high PPV -> increase intrathoracic pressure -> compress the heart -> decrease venous return and preload -> decrease CO -> **decrease BP** and backward reflux of fluids -> **pulmonary edema**
    - impaired cerebral venous return -> **increase ICP** due to backward pressure
    - **hepatic and renal dysfunction**
        - decrease venous return -> backward flow of blood to liver -> hepatomegaly and impaired liver function
        - high PPV -> cardiac compression and decrease blood flow to these organs 

5. ### GIT 

- abdominal distension -> decrease lung capacity -> patient can't breate normally

**action:**

- NGT to decompress air and prevent by maintaining cuff inflation
- ETT -> pharyngeal stimulation -> vomiting
- sedation and immobiliy -> constipation -> do enema


# questions
