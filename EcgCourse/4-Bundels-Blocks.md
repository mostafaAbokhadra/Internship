### Bundles Blocks
they are **3 types**
1. left bundle Brach Block (LBBB)
2. right bundle Brach Block (RBBB)
3. inter-ventricular conduction delay (IVCD)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> to diagnose any type of bundels blocks, <mark>QRS</mark> must be wide, so this is the first thing to look at, if not wide exclude Bundel block

> [!NOTE]
> the <mark>"Block"</mark> word in the term Brach Block, it doesn't mean an actual Block!, it means only a <mark>Delay</mark>

### qrs
- normal qrs **width** is <mark>2.5mm</mark>
- <mark>2.5mm - 3mm</mark> is incomplete bundle branch block
- <mark>> 3mm</mark> is complete bundle branch block

### left bundle Brach Block (LBBB)

### right bundle Brach Block (RBBB)

### inter-ventricular conduction delay (IVCD)
- delay, but not severe enough to be diagnosed as either LBBB or RBBB
