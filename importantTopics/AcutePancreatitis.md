### Acute Pancreatitis

> [!NOTE]
> The two most common etiologies of AP are <mark>gallstones</mark> (40%-70%) and <mark>alcohol</mark> (25%-35%).

Other causes include medications, infectious diseases, and metabolic causes such as hypercalcemia and hypertriglyceridemia

**diagnosed by:**

1. Abdominal pain
2. serum amylase or lipase greater than 3 times upper normal limit
3. Characteristic findings from abdominal imaging

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Nowadays, there are no specific medications found to effectively treat AP, and therefore management is focused on supportive interventions such as fluid resuscitation and nutrition intervention.

#### **Phases**

1. **Early phase (within 1 wk)**:
    characterized by both local pancreatic inflammation, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and/or organ failure
2. **Late phase (> 1 wk)**:
    characterized by local complications and/or persistent organ failure

### Pathophysiology

- Inflammatory cytokines, stress hormones released during pancreatitis results in abnormal metabolism which is similar to sepsis
- REE(resting energy expenditure) is higher in these patients because of inflammation-induced hypermetabolism and/or septic complications.
- Severe inflammation leads to protein catabolism
- hyperglycemia is often found in patients with pancreatitis, It is a result of insulin resistance, increased glucose production from liver (gluconeogenesis), and impaired insulin secretion caused by beta-cell damage
- Hypertriglyceridemia is common, and can be either a cause or a consequence of pancreatitis. Lipid catabolism and impaired lipid clearance, resulting from decreased insulin secretion, contribute to elevated serum triglycerides
- Malnutrition in AP can arise from decreased oral intake as a result of anorexia, abdominal pain, vomiting, ileus, gastroparesis, gastric outlet obstruction, and inappropriate fasting for pancreatic rest[20]. In addition, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction leads to maldigestion of nutrients and may persist up to 6-18 mo after acute attack

### severity

1. **mild**: if no organ failure and no local systemic complications
2. **moderate**: transient organ failure resolves within 48h
3. **severe**: persistent organ failure, one or multiple

> [!NOTE]
> you can use SOFA scale to assess organs dysfunction

### nutrition for mild cases
- Mild cases is transient, self-limiting, and therefore specialized nutrition care (EN and/or PN), is not generally required
- consume oral diet when abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting are improved
- A full caloric, solid diet can be started safely and a stepwise introduction of oral diet, beginning with clear liquids, is unnecessary
- Tube feeding is only recommended when oral nutrition is not feasible for more than 5 d

### nutrition for moderate to severe cases
- intake = 25 kcal/kg/d
- Estimated protein requirements are higher than healthy individuals (1.2-1.5 g/kg/d). 
- A daily dose of multivitamins and trace elements is recommended 
- Enternal feeding is the preferred route after adequate resuscitation and stable hemodynamic status.
- continuous feeding is recommended over bolus feeding decrease residuals and vomiting compared with continuous infusion
- parentral nutrition is indicated when patients cannot tolerate EN. Some patients develop intestinal failure type I or II from systemic or local complications such as severe ileus and duodenal obstruction from pancreatic edema or pseudocyst

**Conclusion**

AP is a common gastrointestinal disease with varying degree of disease severity ranging from self-limiting mild AP to devastating and fatal severe AP. At present, disease-specific treatment remains obscure and supportive care, including nutrition intervention, are crucial. Nutrition treatment not only helps prevent malnutrition, but it is also a key to reduce systemic inflammation, complications, and death. Severity assessment is the first step to guide nutrition intervention. In mild pancreatitis, patients are generally able to initiate solid oral diet and do not require specialized nutrition care. In moderately severe or severe pancreatitis, gut should be considered as an important organ, and early EN should be given to maintain gut function and achieve positive clinical outcomes. Gastric and jejunal feeding are equally effective in severe pancreatitis. Polymeric formula is safe and inexpensive, compared to elemental formula. PN should be administered only in patients who cannot tolerate EN. Some nutritional supplements, such as intravenous glutamine in patients with total PN, may lead to positive outcomes.
