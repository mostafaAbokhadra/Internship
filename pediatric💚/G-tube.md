### Gastrostomy Tube (G-Tube)
خلي بالك دي غير ال colostomy اللي احنا عارفينها وغير ال NGT اللي احنا عارفينها
ال colostomy كان الغرض منها remove stool mainly
انما ال gastrostomy الغرض منها feeding mainly
بندخل tube من gastrostomy اللي احنا بنعملها لحد المعده !
ايوا بالظبط بنخرم المعده وبنثبت tube فالمعده

### **الفرق ما بين الاتنين سريعا كده :**

A colostomy and a gastrostomy are both surgical procedures that create an opening (stoma) to an internal organ, but they serve different purposes and are performed on different parts of the digestive system. Here's a detailed comparison of the two:

### 1. **Gastrostomy**
   - **Definition**: A gastrostomy is a surgical procedure that creates an opening (stoma) directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall. 
   - **Purpose**:
     - To provide a route for long-term nutritional support via a feeding tube when a patient cannot eat by mouth due to conditions affecting swallowing, neurological disorders, or structural problems in the upper GI tract.
     - For gastric decompression in patients with obstructions or motility issues.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Can be done endoscopically (Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy, PEG), surgically, or radiologically.
     - A gastrostomy tube (G-tube) is usually inserted through the stoma for feeding or decompression.
   - **Location**: The stoma is placed in the upper abdomen, leading directly into the stomach.

### 2. **Colostomy**
   - **Definition**: A colostomy is a surgical procedure that creates an opening (stoma) from the colon (large intestine) through the abdominal wall.
   - **Purpose**:
     - To divert fecal matter away from a diseased, injured, or non-functioning part of the colon.
     - Commonly used in cases of colon cancer, diverticulitis, bowel obstruction, traumatic injury, or inflammatory bowel disease.
     - May be temporary (to allow the lower colon or rectum to heal) or permanent (when the rectum and anus are removed or permanently non-functional).
   - **Procedure**:
     - The end of the healthy part of the colon is brought through the abdominal wall and stitched in place, forming a stoma.
     - Waste is expelled through the stoma into a colostomy bag attached externally.
   - **Location**: The stoma is typically placed in the lower abdomen, depending on which part of the colon is affected (e.g., ascending, transverse, descending, or sigmoid colon).

### Key Differences:
1. **Purpose and Function**:
   - **Gastrostomy**: Primarily for feeding or decompression when the upper GI tract is compromised.
   - **Colostomy**: Diverts fecal waste from the colon to bypass a damaged or diseased section.

2. **Target Organ**:
   - **Gastrostomy**: Involves the stomach.
   - **Colostomy**: Involves the colon (large intestine).

3. **Type of Output**:
   - **Gastrostomy**: Delivers nutrition directly into the stomach or removes gastric contents.
   - **Colostomy**: Expels fecal matter through an external bag.

4. **Indications**:
   - **Gastrostomy**: Conditions impairing swallowing, feeding, or requiring gastric decompression.
   - **Colostomy**: Conditions affecting the colon, such as cancer, inflammatory diseases, or injury.

5. **Stoma Management**:
   - **Gastrostomy**: Managed with a feeding tube and careful attention to feeding regimens and stoma care.
   - **Colostomy**: Managed with a colostomy bag to collect fecal output, with attention to stoma care and bag maintenance.
