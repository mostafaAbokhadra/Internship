#### Institute of Safe Medication Practice (ISMP) Classification

#### 1. classes

1. adrenergic agonists, IV <mark>(e.g., epinephrine, phenylephrine, norepinephrine)</mark>
2. adrenergic antagonists, IV <mark>(e.g., propranolol, metoprolol, labetalol)</mark>
3. anesthetic agents مخدر, general, inhaled and IV <mark>(e.g., propofol, ketamine)</mark>
4. antiarrhythmics, IV <mark>(e.g., lidocaine, amiodarone)</mark>
> [!NOTE]
> lidocaine main use is to treat ventricular arrhythmias e:g ventricalr tachycardia and fibrillation
> monitor ECG for excessive depression in cardiac conductiviy, BP for hypotension
5. antithrombotic agents (anticoagulants), including <mark>warfarin, low-molecular-weight heparin, IV unfractionated heparin</mark>, Factor Xa inhibitors </mark>(fondaparinux)</mark>, direct thrombin inhibitors <mark>(e.g., argatroban, lepirudin, bivalirudin)</mark>, thrombolytics <mark>(e.g., alteplase, reteplase, tenecteplase)</mark>, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors <mark>(e.g., eptifibatide)</mark>
6. cardioplegic شلل عضلة القلب solutions 
7. chemotherapeutic agents, parenteral and oral
8. dextrose, hypertonic, 20% or greater
9. dialysis solutions, peritoneal and hemodialysis
10. epidural or intrathecal medications
11. hypoglycemics, oral
12. inotropic medications, IV <mark>(e.g., digoxin, milrinone)</mark>
13. liposomal forms of drugs <mark>(e.g., liposomal amphotericin B)</mark>
14. moderate sedation agents, IV <mark>(e.g., midazolam)</mark>
15. moderate sedation agents, oral, for children <mark>(e.g., chloral hydrate)</mark>
16. narcotics/opiates, IV, transdermal, and oral (including liquid concentrates, immediate and sustained-release formulations)
17. neuromuscular blocking agents <mark>(e.g., succinylcholine, rocuronium, vecuronium)</mark> these durgs stop the muscles from working for a short period of time. They relax the skeletal muscles during surgery or other procedures that call for general anesthesia
18. radiocontrast agents, IV
19. total parenteral nutrition solutions

#### 2. specific medications

1. **colchicine** injection prevent gout attacks, treats familial mediterranean fever حمى البحر الابيض المتوسط 
2. **epoprostenol** (Flolan), IV, it is a vasodilators and platelet-aggregation inhibitors used to treat certain kinds of pulmonary arterial hypertension
3. **insulin**, subcutaneous and IV
4. **magnesium sulfate** injection, works as anticonvulsant, treats hypomagnesemia, constipation
5. **methotrexate** oral, non-oncologic use, it is an anti-metabolite anti folates nhibiting DNA synthesis, most commonly used in chemotherapy and immunosuppressant in auto-immune diseases, and the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
6. **oxytocin**, IV
7. **nitroprusside sodium** for injection, used to treat acute hypertension crises, Acute decompensated heart failure, It is a potent vasodilator administered as an IV infusion with intensive monitoring in place
8. **potassium chloride** for injection concentrate
9. **potassium phosphates** injection
10. **promethazine**, IV, it is first-generation antihistamine, it has antidopaminergic, antihistamine, and anticholinergic properties, used to treat Allergic conditions ncluding seasonal allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis, uncomplicated skin manifestations of urticaria, and angioedema.Promethazine is also indicated as adjunctive therapy to epinephrine for anaphylactic reactions, control nausea and vomiting associated with anesthesia or chemotherapy, Motion sickness: Promethazine can serve as prophylactic therapy for motion sickness; it is most effective when given 30 minutes to 1 hour before the triggering event, and for sedation
11. **sodium chloride** for injection, **hypertonic** (greater than 0.9% concentration)
12. **sterile water** for injection, inhalation, and irrigation (excluding pour bottles) in containers of 100 mL or more

### medication and it's potential complications

1. **insulin** -> hypoglycemia
	 - Look alike sound alike medication <mark>​(i.e. mixtard vs insulatard, Insugen N vs Insugen R)​</mark>
2. **opioids** (analgesics) ->respiratory depression, pinpoint pupils, confusion and convulsion
	- e:g <mark>morphine, codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, tramadol</mark>
	- hydromorphone is 5 times more potent than morphine
	- 1mg of hydromorphone PO is equivalent to 5mg of morphine PO
3.  **potassium chloride or phosphate** -> mental confusion, muscles weakness, flaccid paralysis, oliguria, hyperkalemia, respiratory distress, hypotension, bradycardia, arrythmia or arrest
	- the 1st is used to treat k+ deficiency
	- the 2nd is a phosphate replacement for hypophosphatemia
4. iv anticoagulants -> uncontrolled hemorrhage

**all of these complication may occur due to errors in:**
1. concentration
2. rates 
3. frequency
4. dose
5. medication type e:g insulin type
6. preparation errors


### prevention of errors strategies

- specific storage, prescribing, preparation, administration, or monitoring processes.
- report errors
- labeling all high alert meds
- counterchecked and verified by another pharmacist when issued from pharmacy
- limit availability in floor stocks
- make list of all available insulins and high alerts
- countercheck before administration
- don't store with insulin with heparin
- maintain infusion pumps accuracy through periodic checks of of settings
- label to differentiate different type of insulin
- don't store potassium next to 50% dextrose
- wight patient for accurate dose of heparin
