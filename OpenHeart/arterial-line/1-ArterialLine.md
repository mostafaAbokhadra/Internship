### arterial line
- Arterial lines may be inserted into various arteries, with the radial and femoral arteries being commonly preferred due to their accessibility. Alternatively, arterial lines can be placed in the brachial artery, the dorsalis pedis artery, or the ulnar artery.
- Palpation or ultrasound can aid in locating the artery accurately
- Before arterial catheterization, confirming the presence of collateral circulation to the affected area is crucial, ensuring peripheral circulation is maintained by an alternate artery in case of disruption in the cannulated artery. The Allen test, performed at the wrist, is one such method to assess collateral flow in the hand.

### indications
- it is a routine and standard procedure in intensive care settings, emergency rooms, and the operating room. 
- it facilitate a one-time or frequent arterial blood sampling to assess oxygenation and acid-base status, as well as for hemodynamic monitoring through the evaluation of various patterns of arterial waveforms.
- In cases of hypoxemic respiratory failure, arterial lines enable the calculation of the oxygenation index (OI), a crucial metric for assessing lung disease severity. OI is computed as mean airway pressure divided by the product of arterial oxygen partial pressure and fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2). An OI exceeding 8 indicates moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while an OI surpassing 16 signifies severe ARDS.
- cardiac and radiological interventions, manual or automated exchange transfusions, plasmapheresis, continuous arterio-venous perfusion, hemodialysis, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> arterial lines should never be used for medication administration, as doing so can result in severe complications, including <mark>paresthesias, intense pain, motor dysfunction, compartment syndrome, gangrene, and limb loss</mark>

### contraindications

#### absolute
- Peripheral or distal arterial insufficiency
- Peripheral arterial vascular diseases, including the small-to-medium vasculitides
- A lack of collateral circulation due to anatomical anomalies, such as the congenital absence of the ulnar artery
- Infection at the catheter insertion site (less risk with the more peripheral locations)

#### relative
- hypercoagulable and anticoagulated states
- surgical interventions at the insertion site
- overlying burns

### equipments
- it usually comes in pre-packaged kits
