### Ventilator-Associated Lung Injury

Ventilator-associated lung injury often occurs when ventilator settings are not adjusted based on PBW(patient body weight) especially in conditions like ARDS characterized by stiff lungs. Utilizing a lung-protective strategy involving low tidal volumes and targeted airway pressures is crucial to prevent lung injuries in these cases.[20]

### Ventilator-Associated Events 

Ventilator-associated events refer to a deterioration in respiratory status after a period of stability or improvement on the ventilator, accompanied by evidence of infection or inflammation and laboratory confirmation of respiratory infection. Risk factors for ventilator-associated events include sedation (such as with benzodiazepines or propofol), fluid overload, high tidal-volume ventilation, and high inspiratory driving pressures. Strategies to mitigate ventilator-associated events include implementing ventilator bundles to reduce sedation, conducting daily spontaneous awakening and breathing trials, promoting early mobilization, adopting conservative fluid and transfusion strategies, and employing lung-protective ventilation strategies.

### Hemodynamic Changes

Transitioning a patient to mechanical ventilation shifts from natural negative pressure ventilation to positive pressure ventilation, impacting heart-lung physiology and altering hemodynamic status. Positive pressure ventilation elevates intrathoracic pressure, leading to decreased right ventricular preload and left ventricular preload and afterload. Additionally, the increased pressure augments the right ventricular afterload. Although these effects may have minimal impact on the hemodynamics of a healthy individual, they can cause significant alterations in critically ill patients. For instance, a patient with acute pulmonary edema may benefit from reduced preload, whereas this change may not be beneficial for someone in septic shock.
