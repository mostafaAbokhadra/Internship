mv -> decrease preload -> CO -> MAP -> so be carful with patients who may not be able to increase their SVR, like in patients with distributive shock (septic, neurogenic, or anaphylactic shock).

mv -> reduce work of breathing -> less blood to muscles -> less lactate and co2 generation -> help improve acidosis

mv -> decrease preload and CO -> addition benefit with cardiopulmonary edema as less blood is going to the lung

Any disease that destroys lung parenchyma like emphysema =>  increase compliance

any disease that generates stiffer lungs like ARDS, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pulmonary fibrosis -> decrease lung compliance.

stiff lung ? -> small increase in volume generates large increase in pressure -> barotrauma

stiff lung ? -> can't increase VT or Ve to treat acidosis -> increase RR

peak pressure -> a measure of airway resistance

platue pressure -> measure of alveolar pressure and lung compliance

asthma -> compliance frequently changes -> unreliable tidal volumes-> hypercapnia or hyperventilation.

when initiating mv, first we decide either volume control or pressure control, then deciding the mode, set your setting and parameters and decide triggers

-> listen to the air entry to lungs, oxygen sat and do apg

assist control mode -> vent will assist each breath patient takes even when above the preset rate, will deliver mandatory if rate less than preset rate

simv -> only assist or mandate breath to the presset rr, any other breates taking by patient will not receive volume or pressure support

psv -> relies completely on patient-triggered breaths -> no preset vt or rr -> may lead to co2 retention and acidosis
