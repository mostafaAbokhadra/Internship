# PAC mode(Pressure Assist-Control):
Here, the pressure applied by the ventilator is fixed. Instead of guaranteeing a set volume, it guarantees a fixed pressure. If the lungs are compliant (expand easily), more air (VT) will enter. If the lungs are stiff (low compliance), less air enters. This means the volume of air (VT) varies depending on how easily the lungs expand.

The following parameters must be adjusted on the ventilator when using PAC mode:

- **Inspiratory pressure (Pi)**: the inspiratory pressure level is usually set between 10 and 20 cm H2O, based on the patient's underlying condition to achieve adequate VT.
- **Inspiratory time (Ti)**: Inspiratory time is typically set to <mark>1 second</mark> and adjusted to achieve an I:E ratio of 1:2 to 1:3. 
- **PEEP and FiO2** settings are selected <mark>similarly to VAC mode</mark>. However, the inspiratory pressure adds additional pressure to the peak airway pressure and may further increase the risk of barotrauma.
