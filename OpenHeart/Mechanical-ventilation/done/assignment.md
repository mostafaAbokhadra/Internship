### important terms and parameters

1. **Ventilation**: Exchange of air between the lungs and the air (ambient or delivered by a ventilator), in other words, it is the process of moving air in and out of the lungs.

> ventilation most important effect is the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the body, not on increasing blood oxygen content.

Ventilation is measured as minute ventilation in the clinical setting, and it is calculated as <mark>respiratory rate (RR) times tidal volume (Vt)</mark>.

> In a mechanically ventilated patient, the CO2 content of the blood can be modified by changing the tidal volume or the respiratory rate.

2. **Oxygenation**: Interventions that provide greater oxygen supply to the lungs, thus the circulation. In a mechanically ventilated patient, this can be achieved by increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2%) or the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

3. **PEEP**: The positive pressure that will remain in the airways at the end of the respiratory cycle (end of exhalation) is greater than the atmospheric pressure in mechanically ventilated patients.

4. **Tidal volume**(VT): Volume of air moved in and outside the lungs in each respiratory cycle.

5. **FiO2**: Percentage of oxygen in the air mixture that is delivered to the patient.

6. **Flow**: Speed in liters per minute at which the ventilator delivers breaths.

7. **Compliance**: Change in volume divided by change in pressure. In respiratory physiology, total compliance is a mix of lung and chest wall compliance as these two factors cannot be separated in a patient.

8. **RR or f**
the number of breaths you take per minute

9. **I:E** (inspiration to expiration ratio)
A typical I:E ratio for most situations would be 1:2

10. **Peak pressure** is the pressure achieved during inspiration when the air is being pushed into the lungs and is a measure of **airway resistance**

11. **Plateau pressure** is the static pressure achieved at the end of a full inspiration. To measure plateau pressure, we need to perform an inspiratory hold on the ventilator to permit the pressure to equalize through the system. Plateau pressure is a **measure of alveolar pressure and lung compliance**, Normal plateau pressure is <mark>below 30 cm H20</mark>, and higher pressure can generate barotrauma.

### Indications for Mechanical Ventilation
1. acute respiratory failure, either hypoxic or hypercapnic.(most common)
2. decreased level of consciousness with an inability to protect the airway
3. respiratory distress that failed non-invasive positive pressure ventilation
5. severe angioedema, or any case of airway compromise such as airway burns, cardiac arrest, and shock.
6. elective indications for mechanical ventilation are surgical procedures and neuromuscular disorders.

### Contraindications

There are no direct contraindications for mechanical ventilation as it is a life-saving measure in a critically ill patient, and all patients should be offered the opportunity to benefit from this if needed.

The only absolute contraindication for mechanical ventilation is if it is against the patient's stated wishes for artificial life-sustaining measures.

The only relative contraindication is if non-invasive ventilation is available and its use is expected to resolve the need for mechanical ventilation. This should be started first as it has fewer complications than mechanical ventilation.

### modes 

#### Assist Control Ventilation (AC)

Assist control is when the ventilator will assist the patient by delivering support for every breath the patient takes (that is the assist part), and the ventilator will have control over the respiratory rate if it goes below the set rate (control part). In assist control, if the rate is set at 12 and the patient breathes at 18, the ventilator will assist with the 18 breaths, but if the rate drops to 8, the ventilator will take over control of the respiratory rate and deliver 12 breaths in a minute.

In assist control ventilation, the breath can be delivered by either giving volume or giving pressure. This is termed **volume-assist control** or **pressure-assist control** ventilation. In order to maintain simplicity, and understand that given that ventilation is commonly a major problem than pressure and that volume control is used overwhelmingly more commonly than pressure control, the focus for the remainder of this review will use the term "volume control" interchangeably when discussing assist control.

Assist control (volume control) is the mode of choice used in the majority of intensive care units throughout the United States because it is easy to use. Four settings can be easily adjusted in the ventilator **(respiratory rate, tidal volume, FiO2, and PEEP)**. The volume delivered by the ventilator in each breath in assist control will always be the same, regardless of the breath being initiated by the patient or the ventilator, and regardless of compliance, peak, or plateau pressures in the lungs.

Each breath can be **time-triggered** (if the patient's respiratory rate is below the set ventilator rate, the machine will deliver breaths at a set interval of time) or **patient-triggered** if the patient initiates a breath on its own. This makes assist control a very comfortable mode for the patient as each of his or her efforts will be supplemented by the ventilator.

After making changes on the vent or after starting a patient on mechanical ventilation, careful consideration of checking arterial blood gases should be made and the oxygen saturation on the monitor should be followed to determine if further changes should be made to the ventilator.

The advantages of AC mode are increased comfort, easy corrections for respiratory acidosis/alkalosis, and low work breathing for the patient. Some disadvantages include that being a volume-cycled mode, pressures cannot be directly controlled which may cause barotrauma, the patient can develop hyperventilation with breath stacking, auto-PEEP, and respiratory alkalosis.

### Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV)

SIMV is another frequently used mode of ventilation, although its use had been falling out of favor given its less reliable tidal volumes and failure to show better outcomes when compared to AC.

"**Synchronized**" means that the ventilator will adjust the delivery of its breaths with the patient's efforts. "**Intermittent**" means that not all breaths are necessarily supported, and "**mandatory ventilation**" means that, as with AC, a set rate is selected and the ventilator will deliver these mandatory breaths each minute regardless of the patient's respiratory efforts. The mandatory breaths can be triggered by the patient or by time if the patient's RR is slower than the ventilator RR (as with AC). The difference from AC is that in SIMV the ventilator only will deliver the breaths that the rate is set up to deliver, any breath taken by the patient above this rate will not receive a full tidal volume or pressure support. This means that for **each breath the patient takes above the set RR, the tidal volume pulled by the patient will depend solely on lung compliance and patient effort**. This has been proposed as a method of "training" the diaphragm in order to maintain the muscular tone and wean off patients from the ventilator faster. Nonetheless, multiple studies have failed to show any advantages to SIMV. Furthermore, SIMV generates higher work of breathing than AC, which negatively impacts outcomes as well as generates respiratory fatigue. A general rule to go by is that the patient will be liberated from the ventilator when he or she is ready, and no specific mode of ventilation will make this faster. In the meantime, it is better to keep the patient as comfortable as possible and SIMV may not be the best mode to achieve this.

### Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV)

PSV is a ventilator mode that relies completely on patient-triggered breaths. As the name implies it is a pressure-driven mode of ventilation. In this setting all breaths are patient-triggered as the ventilator has no backup rate, so each breath has to be started by the patient. In this mode, the ventilator will **cycle between two different pressures** (PEEP and pressure support). PEEP will be the remaining pressure at the end of exhalation, and pressure support is the pressure above(+) the PEEP that the ventilator will administer during each breath for support of ventilation. This means that if a patient is set up in PSV 10/5, the patient will receive 5 cm H2O of PEEP, and during inhalation, he will receive 15 cm H2O of support (10 PS above PEEP).

Because there is no backup rate, this mode is not for use in patients with decreased consciousness, shock, or cardiac arrest. The tidal volumes will depend solely on the patient's effort and lung compliance.

PSV often is used for ventilator weaning as it only augments patients breathing efforts but does not deliver a set tidal volume or respiratory rate.

The biggest drawback of PSV is its unreliable tidal volumes that **may generate CO2 retention and acidosis** as well as the higher work of breathing which can lead to respiratory fatigue.

To address this concern, a new algorithm for PSV was created called volume support ventilation (VSV). VSV is a similar mode to PSV, but in this mode, the tidal volume is used as feedback control, as the pressure support given to the patient will be constantly adjusted to the tidal volume. In this setting, if the tidal volume is decreasing, the ventilator will increase the pressure support to increase the tidal volume and if the tidal volume increases the pressure support will decrease in order to keep the tidal volume close to the desired minute ventilation. There is some evidence suggesting that the use of VSV may decrease assisted ventilation time, total weaning time, and total T-piece time as well as a decreased need for sedation.

### Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV)

As the name suggests, in APRV mode the ventilator will deliver a constant high airway pressure that will deliver oxygenation, and ventilation will be served by releasing that pressure.

This mode has recently gained popularity as an alternative for **difficult-to-oxygenate patients** with ARDS in whom other modes of ventilation fail to reach the set targets. APRV has been described as a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with an intermittent release phase. What this means is that the ventilator applies a continuous high pressure (P high) for a set amount of time (T high) and then releases that pressure, usually going back to zero (P low) for a much shorter period of time (T low).

The idea behind this is that during T high (which covers 80% to 95% of the cycle), there is constant alveolar recruitment, which improves oxygenation as the time maintained on high pressure is much longer than in other types of ventilation (open lung strategy). This reduces the repetitive inflation and deflation of the lungs that happens with other ventilator modes, **preventing ventilator-induced lung injury**. During this time (T high) the patient is free to breathe spontaneously (which makes it comfortable) but he will be pulling low tidal volumes as exhaling against such pressure is harder. Then, when T high is reached, the pressure in the ventilator will go down to P low (usually zero). This allows for air to be rushed out of the airways allowing for passive exhalation until T low is reached and the vent delivers another breath. To prevent airway collapse during this time the T low is set short, usually around **0.4-0.8** seconds. What happens here is that when the ventilator pressure goes to zero, the elastic recoil of the lungs pushes air out, but the time is not enough for all the air to leave the lungs, so the alveolar and airway pressure does not reach zero and there is no airway collapse. This time is usually set up so that T low ends when the exhalation flow drops to 50% of the initial flow.

Minute ventilation, then, will depend on T low and the patient's tidal volumes during T high.

#### Indications for the use of APRV:
1. ARDS that is difficult to oxygenate with AC
2. Acute lung injury
3. Postoperative atelectasis.

**Advantages of APRV**:

APRV is a good mode for lung protection ventilation. The ability to set the P high means that the operator has control over the plateau pressure which can significantly lower the incidence of barotrauma

Because the patient initiates his respiratory efforts, there is better gas distribution secondary to improved V/Q matching.

Constant high pressure means more recruitment (open lung strategy)

APRV may improve oxygenation in ARDS patients who are difficult to oxygenate on AC

APRV may reduce the need for sedation and neuromuscular blocking agents as the patient may be more comfortable than with other modes.

**Disadvantages and contraindications**:

Given that spontaneous breathing is an important aspect of APRV, it is not ideal for **heavily sedated patients**

No data for APRV use in **neuromuscular disorders or obstructive lung disease** and its use should be avoided in these patient populations

Theoretically, constant high intrathoracic pressure could generate high pulmonary artery pressure and worsen intracardiac shunts in patients with **Eisenmenger physiology**

Strong clinical reasoning should be employed when selecting APRV as the mode of ventilation over more conventional modes such as AC.

### weaning criteria
There are simple criteria that should be satisfied before a patient is determined to be ready for extubation:

- The indication for intubation and mechanical ventilation must be resolved
- The patient has to be able to maintain adequate gas exchange on its own without the help of positive pressure ventilation
- There must be no auto-PEEP
- The patient must have an adequate cardiovascular reserve (for example, in heart failure patients in which removing the vent can precipitate new pulmonary edema)
- There should not be copious amounts of secretions in the ET tube that could generate high airway resistance and obstruction after extubation
- The patient must be able to protect his or her airway.

A **sedation holiday** should be done daily to assess readiness for extubation with appropriate mental status and ability to protect the airway as well as to permit spontaneous breathing. This is usually protocolized in all intensive care units (ICU) and should be performed in every patient who is stable and in whom the indication for mechanical ventilation has resolved. During these daily trials, sedation is reduced to a minimum or completely eliminated until the patient is awake and cooperative but comfortable.

The second parameter is the SBT itself. To perform this, ventilator support should be reduced to a minimum. This can be done either via **T-piece or pressure support**. CPAP has been used in the past although it has been suggested to be inferior to the other two methods. A recent Cochrane review (2014) concluded that there are no major differences between T piece or pressure support trials on extubation success, reintubation, ICU mortality, or ICU length of stay. Nevertheless, pressure support was found to be superior for performing spontaneous breathing trials among patients with simple weaning (meaning patients successfully weaned in the first attempt) as it was shown to have a shorter weaning time.

SBT should be performed for **30 to 120** minutes, and the patient should be monitored closely for any signs of respiratory distress. If these signs are found, the patient should be placed back on his or her prior ventilator settings.

If after this time patient meets criteria for successful SBT (RR < 35bpm; no signs of distress; HR <140/min and HR variability less than 20%; O2 sat greater than 90% or PaO2 greater than 60 mmHg on FiO2 less than 0.4; SBP greater than 80 and less than 180 mmHg or less than 20% change from baseline), then the assessment for airway removal should be done by performing a cuff leak test when indicated.

If the patient is determined to be ready, the ETT should be removed and the patient should be monitored closely. In patients with high risk for reintubation (failure of two or more SBTs, CHF, CO2 greater than 45 after extubation, weak cough, pneumonia as a cause of respiratory failure), the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation after extubation as a bridge to ventilator free-breathing, has been shown to reduce ICU mortality and lower risk of intubation. This effect was not seen if the patient had already developed respiratory distress. High flow nasal cannula has also shown reduced reintubation rates, although no effect on mortality has been seen.

### alarms causes and managements

### complications of MV

Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving intervention for many patients, but it can also lead to various complications. These complications can be categorized into several groups:

### Respiratory System Complications:

* **Barotrauma:** Overinflation of the lungs can cause damage to the alveoli and surrounding tissues, leading to conditions like pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema.
* **Volutrauma:** Excessive tidal volumes can also cause lung injury, particularly in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
* **Atelectasis:** Collapse of lung segments due to inadequate ventilation or surfactant deficiency.
* **Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP):** Infection of the lungs associated with mechanical ventilation.
* **Oxygen Toxicity:** Prolonged exposure to high concentrations of oxygen can damage lung tissue.

### Cardiovascular System Complications:

* **Hemodynamic Instability:** Mechanical ventilation can affect blood pressure and heart rate, particularly in patients with underlying cardiovascular conditions.
* **Arrhythmias:** Changes in intrathoracic pressure can trigger arrhythmias in some patients.
* **Renal Dysfunction:** Decreased blood flow to the kidneys can lead to renal dysfunction or failure.

### Neurological Complications:

* **Traumatic Brain Injury:** If the patient is already suffering from a traumatic brain injury, mechanical ventilation can exacerbate the condition.
* **Neuromuscular Weakness:** Prolonged mechanical ventilation can lead to muscle weakness and atrophy.

### Other Complications:

* **Infection:** Ventilated patients are at increased risk of infections, including bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections.
* **Psychological Distress:** Being on a ventilator can be distressing for patients, leading to anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

**To minimize these complications, it is essential to:**

* **Monitor the patient closely:** Continuously monitor vital signs, lung mechanics, and laboratory tests.
* **Use appropriate ventilator settings:** Adjust ventilator settings based on the patient's condition and goals of care.
* **Prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia:** Implement strategies to prevent infection, such as proper hand hygiene and oral care.
* **Manage other risk factors:** Address underlying conditions that may increase the risk of complications.

### vap bundel
Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the most serious treatment-related infections resulting in high mortalities and costs . (VAP) is one of the main types of infection in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients, leading to increased mortality, morbidity, hospital stay, economic and psychological costs for patients and their families . 
During the last two decades, many guidelines have been proposed to reduce the incidence of VAP. It has been scientifically proven that interventions must be combined in order to be useful .
Bundle is a set of individual components, combined to make a set of quality indicators for a specific system, procedure, or treatment .
These interventions must be all implemented together to achieve significantly better results .
VAP bundle 
1. Subglottic suction tubes
Secretions are potentially able to bypass the ETT cuff, especially when it is deflated . Secretions that 
pool above the ETT but below the vocal cords are a potential source of pathogens that could cause 
VAP. Since conventional suction methods cannot access this area, ETT tubes that have a designated 
suction catheter for this space allow this pool to be drained. 
2. Cuff pressures
Micro-aspiration can be reduced by maintaining an endotracheal tube cuff pressure between 20-30 
cmH2O. Based on recent recommendations, cuff pressure should be checked and adjusted around 25 
cmH2O, at least 4 hourly. It is noted that individual assessment is required as there will be cases 
where a patient’s clinical condition and ventilation may require higher pressures - the rationale for  
this decision must be documented and the position reviewed as a minimum daily .
3. Daily sedation interruption and assessment of readiness to extubate 
Sedation of intubated patients to ensure patient comfort is universal practice. Continuous sedation  
can lead to accumulation of sedatives and over sedation, and is associated with increased duration of 
mechanical ventilation. Since intubation and mechanical ventilation predisposes patients to VAP, 
reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation should reduce that time at risk for developing VAP. 
Strategies used successfully to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation are daily sedation 
interruption (DSI) and daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). More recently there has been a move 
towards targeted sedation to allow the patient to be calm, comfortable and cooperative which broadly 
equates to a RASS score of -1/0.
4. Semi recumbent positioning
Aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastric contents is implicated in the pathogenesis of VAP. Nursing 
the mechanically ventilated patient in a semi-recumbent position aims to prevent aspiration of gastric 
content. Whilst elevating the bed to 45 degrees has been shown to reduce VAP, practically this does 
not appear to be achievable. The exact degree of elevation needed to prevent VAP is unclear but 
aiming to avoid the supine position and raising the bed to at least 30 degrees is recommended.
5. Avoidance of scheduled ventilator circuit changes
Humidified gases condense in the ventilator circuitry and are at risk of becoming contaminated. 
Evidence suggests that frequent circuit changes are associated with an increased incidence of VAP, 
probably due to the excessive manipulation of the ventilator circuit causing contaminated secretions 
to enter the bronchial tree via the ETT lumen. Changing the ventilator circuit should occur only when 
clinically indicated such as visible soiling or when faulty, following manufacturer’s recommendations 
(7-14 days). This does not increase the incidence of VAP and would result in significant cost savings 
compared to routine changing of circuit .
6. Stress ulcer prophylaxis
The prevention of stress ulcers must be weighed against the increased risk of VAP. There is
insufficient evidence to give a clear recommendation of the use of SUP and the potential protective 
benefits of enteral feeding. We therefore recommend consideration of the risk profile of GI bleeding 
in each patient with judicious use of SUP in patients considered to be at risk of GI bleeding.
7. Oral Hygiene
In light of this recent evidence the use of oral cholrhexadine is advocated as part of routine oral 
hygiene. Oral hygiene remains important inventilated patients in order to remove dental plaque 
(which may lead to gingivitis or dental caries), for patient comfort, and to promote a ‘normal’ 
microbial community. Therefore, regular oral hygiene remains an essential component of care.

### nursing care for MV patient
Caring for a patient on mechanical ventilation involves meticulous attention to their physical, emotional, and medical needs. The key aspects include:

1. Airway Management:

Securing the airway: Ensure the endotracheal (ET) tube or tracheostomy is properly secured to avoid accidental extubation.

Suctioning: Regular suctioning of the airway is important to prevent mucus buildup, which can block airways and lead to infections.


2. Ventilator Settings:

Monitoring: Frequently check the ventilator settings (tidal volume, respiratory rate, FiO2, PEEP) as prescribed by the physician to ensure optimal oxygenation and ventilation.

Alarms: Always monitor ventilator alarms, which may indicate problems like tube blockage, disconnection, or changes in lung compliance.


3. Infection Prevention:

Oral care: Perform oral hygiene regularly to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Chlorhexidine mouthwash is often used.

Hand hygiene: Wash hands before and after touching the patient, and use sterile techniques for procedures like suctioning.

Positioning: Reposition the patient every 2 hours to prevent pressure ulcers and improve lung function.


4. Sedation and Comfort:

Sedation management: Most patients on mechanical ventilation require sedation to reduce anxiety and prevent self-extubation. Regularly assess the need for sedation using scales like the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS).

Pain management: Administer pain relief as needed, and assess for pain using non-verbal pain indicators.


5. Monitoring and Assessment:

Vital signs: Monitor heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate regularly.

ABGs (Arterial Blood Gases): Periodically check ABG values to assess the patient's oxygenation, ventilation, and acid-base balance.

Fluid balance: Track input/output closely to avoid fluid overload or dehydration.


6. Patient Communication and Emotional Support:

Non-verbal communication: Use communication boards or other assistive methods to help patients express their needs.

Family involvement: Involve family members to provide emotional support and to keep them informed about the patient's condition.


7. Weaning and Extubation (if appropriate):

Weaning protocols: Follow the physician’s orders and use weaning trials to gradually reduce ventilator support if the patient’s condition improves.

Extubation readiness: Assess for extubation readiness based on clinical stability, adequate oxygenation, and strong cough/gag reflexes.


By adhering to these principles, healthcare providers can improve outcomes for patients on mechanical ventilation while minimizing complications.

### role of nurse in weaning (before, during, after)
The role of a nurse in the weaning of a patient from mechanical ventilation (MV) is critical and multifaceted. Here are the key responsibilities:

### 1. *Assessment and Monitoring*
   - *Patient Evaluation*: Continuously assess the patient’s respiratory status, including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and lung sounds.
   - *Vital Signs*: Monitor vital signs closely, watching for any signs of distress or instability.
   - *Sedation Levels*: Evaluate and manage sedation, ensuring the patient is awake enough to participate in weaning.

### 2. *Collaboration with the Healthcare Team*
   - *Interdisciplinary Communication*: Work with respiratory therapists, physicians, and other healthcare providers to develop and implement a weaning plan.
   - *Feedback*: Provide input based on patient assessments and response to the weaning process.

### 3. *Implementation of Weaning Protocols*

   - *Adjusting Ventilator Settings*: Assist in modifying ventilator settings according to the weaning protocol, such as reducing support levels gradually.

### 4. *Patient Education and Support*
   - *Patient and Family Education*: Explain the weaning process to the patient and family to alleviate anxiety and encourage cooperation.
   - *Emotional Support*: Provide emotional and psychological support during the weaning process, recognizing that it can be stressful for patients.

### 5. *Documentation*
   - *Record Keeping*: Document all assessments, interventions, and patient responses accurately to ensure continuity of care.
   - *Weaning Progress*: Keep detailed records of the weaning process, noting any challenges or adverse reactions.

### 6. *Response to Complications*
   - *Identifying Problems*: Quickly recognize signs of respiratory distress or complications during weaning, such as increased work of breathing or changes in vital signs.
   - *Intervention*: Initiate appropriate interventions and notify the healthcare team as necessary.

### 7. *Re-evaluation*
   - *Continuous Evaluation*: Regularly reassess the patient’s readiness for further weaning or the need for re-intubation based on their status.
   - *Adaptation of Plan*: Adjust the weaning plan as needed based on patient feedback and clinical findings.

### Conclusion
The nurse plays a vital role in ensuring a safe and effective weaning process from mechanical ventilation, balancing technical skills with compassionate care. Their involvement is crucial in promoting patient recovery and optimizing outcomes.
