To measure plateau pressure, we need to perform an inspiratory hold on the ventilator to permit the pressure to equalize through the system.

### most common modes of ventilation
1. **assist control (AC)**
2. **pressure support (PS)**
3. **synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV)**
4. **and airway pressure release ventilation (APRV)**

Assist control is when the ventilator will assist the patient by delivering support for every breath the patient takes (that is the assist part), and the ventilator will have control over the respiratory rate if it goes below the set rate (control part). In assist control, if the rate is set at 12 and the patient breathes at 18, the ventilator will assist with the 18 breaths, but if the rate drops to 8, the ventilator will take over control of the respiratory rate and deliver 12 breaths in a minute, pressures cannot be directly controlled which may cause barotrauma, the patient can develop hyperventilation with breath stacking, auto-PEEP, and respiratory alkalosis.

SIMV: "**Synchronized**" means that the ventilator will adjust the delivery of its breaths with the patient's efforts. "**Intermittent**" means that not all breaths are necessarily supported, and "**mandatory ventilation**" means that, as with AC, a set rate is selected and the ventilator will deliver these mandatory breaths each minute regardless of the patient's respiratory efforts.
The difference from AC is that in SIMV the ventilator only will deliver the breaths that the rate is set up to deliver, any breath taken by the patient above this rate will not receive a full tidal volume or pressure support

PSV is a ventilator mode that relies completely on patient-triggered breaths, the ventilator will **cycle between two different pressures** (PEEP and pressure support), PEEP will be the remaining pressure at the end of exhalation, and pressure support is the pressure above(+) the PEEP that the ventilator will administer during each breath for support of ventilation. This means that if a patient is set up in PSV 10/5, the patient will receive 5 cm H2O of PEEP, and during inhalation, he will receive 15 cm H2O of support (10 PS above PEEP) ,Because there is no backup rate, this mode is not for use in patients with decreased consciousness, shock, or cardiac arrest.The tidal volumes will depend solely on the patient's effort and lung compliance.The biggest drawback of PSV is its unreliable tidal volumes that **may generate CO2 retention and acidosis** adn respiratory fatigue.

for **difficult-to-oxygenate patients** with ARDS in whom other modes of ventilation fail to reach the set targets. APRV has been described as a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with an intermittent release phase. What this means is that the ventilator applies a continuous high pressure (P high) for a set amount of time (T high) and then releases that pressure, usually going back to zero (P low) for a much shorter period of time (T low).
This reduces the repetitive inflation and deflation of the lungs that happens with other ventilator modes, **preventing ventilator-induced lung injury**

> [!TIP]
> patient needs MV ? -> you inititated the MV -> next step is to select the delivery method -> pressure controlled or volume controlled ? -> now decide the mode(most commonly initiated with A/C), It is started with a FiO2 of 100% and titrated down guided by pulse oximetry or ABG, depending on the case, Starting the patient on a low tidal volume (6 to 8 mL/Kg of ideal body weight) will reduce the incidence of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), Flow should be initiated at or above 60 L/min to prevent auto-PEEP, Initial RR should be comfortable for the patient 10-12 bpm should suffice. A very important caveat on this is for patients with severe metabolic acidosis. For these patients, the minute ventilation should at least be matched to their pre-intubation ventilation as failure to do so will worsen acidosis and can precipitate complications such as cardiac arrest,Start with a low PEEP of 5 cm H2O and titrate up as tolerated by the patient to the goal for oxygenation, Peak and plateau pressures should be checked on the vent to assure there are no problems with airway resistance or alveolar pressure in order to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury, auscultate lung sounds, do ABG after 30 min of mv and monitore o2sat

The most common corrections that have to be done with the ventilator are to solve **hypoxemia and hypercapnia or hyperventilation**:

**Hypoxia**: Oxygenation depends on the FiO2 and the PEEP (but barotrauma and oxidative damage) -> goal is 92-94% except for cases of **carbon monoxide poisoning** 

A sudden drop in oxygen saturation should raise suspicion for **tube misplacement**, **pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, atelectasis**, or the development of **mucus plugs**.

**Hypercapnia**: To modify CO2 content in blood one needs to modify alveolar ventilation. To do this, the **tidal volume or the respiratory rate**, increasing the rate, will also **increase the amount of dead space** and might not be as effective as tidal volume

**Elevated peak pressure and normal plateau pressure**: high airway resistance and normal compliance.

Possible causes: (1) Kinked ET tube - The solution is to unkink the tube; use a bite lock if the patient is biting on the tube, (2) Mucus plug - The solution is to suction the patient, (3) Bronchospasm -  The solution is to give bronchodilators.

**Elevated Peak and Elevated Plateau**: Compliance Problems
Possible causes include:

**Mainstem intubation**: assess by **unilateral breath sounds and a dull contralateral lung** (atelectatic lung).

**Pneumothorax**: hearing **breath sounds unilaterally** and finding a **hyper-resonant contralateral lung**.In intubated patients, placement of a chest tube is imperative الزامي as the positive pressure will only worsen the pneumothorax.

**Atelectasis**: Initial management consists of **chest percussions** and recruitment maneuvers. Bronchoscopy may be used in resistant cases

**Pulmonary edema**: Diuresis, inotropes, high PEEP

**ARDS**: Use low tidal volume, high RR, high PEEP ventilation

**Dynamic hyperinflation or auto-PEEP**

**patient-ventilator dyssynchrony** usually termed as the patient “fighting the vent”. Important causes include hypoxia, auto-PEEP, not satisfying the patient's oxygenation or ventilation demands, pain, and discomfort. After ruling out important causes such as pneumothorax or atelectasis, patient comfort should be considered and proper sedation and analgesia should be assured. Consider changing the ventilator mode as some patients may respond better to different modes of ventilation.

COPD(chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure) patients very prone to developing auto-PEEP. Using a preventive ventilation strategy with **high flow and low respiratory rate**

ARDS is a type of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. An open lung strategy with high PEEP and low tidal volume has been shown to improve mortality.

**Pulmonary embolism** is a difficult situation. These patients are very preload-dependent secondary to the acute increase in right atrial pressure. Intubating these patients will increase RA pressure and further decrease venous return, which may precipitate shock. If there is no way to prevent intubation, careful attention to blood pressure and initiation of vasopressors should be done promptly.

Severe pure **metabolic acidosis** is a concern. When intubating these patients, careful attention should be paid to their pre-intubation minute ventilation. If this ventilation is not provided when starting mechanical support, pH will drop further possibly precipitating cardiac arrest. 

### weaning criteria
There are simple criteria that should be satisfied before a patient is determined to be ready for extubation:

- The indication for intubation and mechanical ventilation must be resolved
- The patient has to be able to maintain adequate gas exchange on its own without the help of positive pressure ventilation
- There must be no auto-PEEP
- The patient must have an adequate cardiovascular reserve (for example, in heart failure patients in which removing the vent can precipitate new pulmonary edema)
- There should not be copious amounts of secretions in the ET tube that could generate high airway resistance and obstruction after extubation
- The patient must be able to protect his or her airway.

A **sedation holiday** should be done daily to assess readiness for extubation with appropriate mental status and ability to protect the airway as well as to permit spontaneous breathing. This is usually protocolized in all intensive care units (ICU) and should be performed in every patient who is stable and in whom the indication for mechanical ventilation has resolved. During these daily trials, sedation is reduced to a minimum or completely eliminated until the patient is awake and cooperative but comfortable.

The second parameter is the SBT itself. To perform this, ventilator support should be reduced to a minimum. This can be done either via **T-piece or pressure support**. CPAP has been used in the past although it has been suggested to be inferior to the other two methods. A recent Cochrane review (2014) concluded that there are no major differences between T piece or pressure support trials on extubation success, reintubation, ICU mortality, or ICU length of stay. Nevertheless, pressure support was found to be superior for performing spontaneous breathing trials among patients with simple weaning (meaning patients successfully weaned in the first attempt) as it was shown to have a shorter weaning time.

SBT should be performed for **30 to 120** minutes, and the patient should be monitored closely for any signs of respiratory distress. If these signs are found, the patient should be placed back on his or her prior ventilator settings.

If after this time patient meets criteria for successful SBT (RR < 35bpm; no signs of distress; HR <140/min and HR variability less than 20%; O2 sat greater than 90% or PaO2 greater than 60 mmHg on FiO2 less than 0.4; SBP greater than 80 and less than 180 mmHg or less than 20% change from baseline), then the assessment for airway removal should be done by performing a cuff leak test when indicated.

If the patient is determined to be ready, the ETT should be removed and the patient should be monitored closely. In patients with high risk for reintubation (failure of two or more SBTs, CHF, CO2 greater than 45 after extubation, weak cough, pneumonia as a cause of respiratory failure), the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation after extubation as a bridge to ventilator free-breathing, has been shown to reduce ICU mortality and lower risk of intubation. This effect was not seen if the patient had already developed respiratory distress. High flow nasal cannula has also shown reduced reintubation rates, although no effect on mortality has been seen.
