No, **APRV** (Airway Pressure Release Ventilation) is not the same as **PIPAP**. In fact, **PIPAP** is not a commonly used term in respiratory therapy or mechanical ventilation. However, it seems like you might be referring to **BIPAP** (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure), which is a well-known ventilation mode, and it shares some similarities with APRV. Let me clarify the differences and similarities between **APRV** and **BIPAP**.

### **APRV (Airway Pressure Release Ventilation)**:
- **Mode**: Mechanical ventilation mode designed primarily for patients with severe lung injury, such as ARDS.
- **Function**: It maintains a prolonged high airway pressure (**P high**) to keep the lungs open and briefly releases pressure (**P low**) to allow for exhalation. Patients are allowed to breathe spontaneously throughout the cycle.
- **Main Focus**: Lung protection by promoting alveolar recruitment and preventing repetitive collapse and overinflation of the lungs.

### **BIPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure)**:
- **Mode**: Non-invasive ventilation mode, typically used for conditions like **sleep apnea**, **COPD**, or other respiratory failure situations where invasive mechanical ventilation is not necessary.
- **Function**: BIPAP provides two levels of pressure:
  - **Inspiratory Positive Airway Pressure (IPAP)**: Higher pressure when the patient inhales to assist with ventilation.
  - **Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP)**: Lower pressure during exhalation to keep the airways open and prevent collapse.
- **Spontaneous Breathing**: Patients breathe spontaneously, with the machine assisting their breaths by adjusting the pressure levels.
  
### Key Differences:
- **Application**: 
  - APRV is typically used in **invasive mechanical ventilation** for critically ill patients who need full ventilatory support, often in the ICU.
  - BIPAP is commonly used in **non-invasive ventilation**, where a mask is placed over the patient's nose or face to provide support, usually for conditions like **obstructive sleep apnea** or **chronic respiratory conditions**.
  
- **Pressure Phases**:
  - In **APRV**, the ventilator switches between **high and low pressure** (with the focus on keeping alveoli open with the high pressure for extended periods).
  - In **BIPAP**, the machine switches between **IPAP and EPAP** to help with inhalation and exhalation, supporting both oxygenation and ventilation but without the long recruitment phase seen in APRV.

### Summary:
- **APRV** is an invasive mode for critically ill patients needing lung protection, while **BIPAP** (sometimes confused with PIPAP) is a non-invasive mode typically used for milder forms of respiratory support.
