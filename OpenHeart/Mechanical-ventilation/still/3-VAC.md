### VAC (Volume Assist-Control):

In this mode, the amount of air (VT) is set to a fixed value. No matter what happens, the machine ensures a specific amount of air enters the lungs. If the lungs are stiff (low compliance), the pressure in the airways will increase to push the set volume of air in. If the lungs are more compliant (expand easily), less pressure is needed.

   ف هنا كمية الهوا اللي بتدخل ثابته احنا محددينها وال pressure بيتغير على حسب ال compliance بتاع ال lung 

   لو ال lung compliant وال patient بيدخله كمية الهوا على طول يبقى ال pressure اللي هحتاجه قليل

   لو مش compliant هحتاج pressure اعلى عشان ادخله كمية الهوا اللي انا محددها

**When VAC mode is chosen, the following parameters have to be set on the ventilator**:

- **Tidal volume** (VT): The tidal volume is usually determined based on ideal or predicted body weight (PBW), rather than actual weight. In conditions such as ARDS that require a protective lung strategy, the VT is set at a low range of 4 to 8 mL/kg PBW.
- **Respiratory rate** (RR): The respiratory rate is typically set between 12 and 16 breaths per minute. A higher respiratory rate (up to 35 breaths per minute) may be selected to achieve sufficient minute ventilation, especially during a protective lung strategy in ARDS to prevent severe hypercapnia or counteract severe acidosis.
- **Inspiratory flow rate** (IFR): The inspiratory flow rate is usually set between 40 and 60 L/min to achieve an inspiratory and expiratory ratio of 1:2 or 1:3. A higher inspiratory flow rate (up to 90 L/min) is often recommended in cases of severe distal airway obstruction, such as acute COPD exacerbation or severe asthma exacerbation. This higher rate allows for longer expiratory time to empty the lungs, targeting an inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio (I:E) greater than 1:3.
- **Fraction of inspired oxygen** (FiO2): FiO2 should be adjusted to the minimum level necessary to maintain a pulse oximetry (SpO2) reading of 90% to 96%. Avoiding hyperoxemia is crucial, as studies have demonstrated an increase in mortality among critically ill patients with excessive oxygen levels.
- **Positive end-expiratory pressure** (PEEP): PEEP increases the functional residual capacity and prevents the collapse of alveoli, thus reducing atelectrauma. Initially, the PEEP level is typically set at 5 cm H2O and adjusted based on the patient's underlying condition and oxygenation requirements. In conditions such as ARDS, PEEP is titrated according to respiratory system mechanics or based on guidelines such as the ARDS network table.
- **Trigger sensitivity**: Triggers can be categorized into 2 types—flow trigger and pressure trigger. Pressure triggers are typically set at -2 cm H2O but should be avoided if auto-PEEP is suspected. In such cases, flow triggers should be used and set at a threshold of 2 L/min.

Let’s break down **trigger sensitivity** and the two types of triggers used in mechanical ventilation: **flow trigger** and **pressure trigger**.

### 1. **What is a Trigger?**
In mechanical ventilation, the **trigger** refers to the setting that controls how and when the ventilator knows to start delivering a breath. Essentially, it’s the signal that tells the ventilator to give the patient air, based on the patient's effort to breathe.

### 2. **Types of Triggers**:
There are two main types:
   
   **a. Pressure Trigger**:
   - In a **pressure trigger**, the ventilator detects when the patient tries to take a breath by measuring the pressure inside the breathing circuit.
   - The ventilator is set to sense when the pressure drops by a certain amount (usually set at **-2 cm H2O**). This drop happens when the patient tries to breathe in, creating a small negative pressure.
   - Once the ventilator senses this drop, it delivers the breath.
   - **Why -2 cm H2O?**: This is a common setting because it’s a small enough change in pressure that the ventilator can quickly detect the patient’s effort to breathe without causing too much delay.

   **b. Flow Trigger**:
   - In a **flow trigger**, the ventilator senses when the patient is starting to breathe in based on changes in the airflow in the circuit.
   - A constant flow of air moves through the circuit, and when the patient tries to inhale, the ventilator detects a slight drop in this flow. For example, if the trigger is set at **2 liters per minute (L/min)**, when the patient tries to breathe and decreases the flow by this amount, the ventilator delivers the breath.
   
### 3. **When to Use Each Type?**
- **Pressure trigger** is commonly used because it’s easy to set and works for most patients. However, it may not be ideal in certain situations.
  
- **Auto-PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure)**: Sometimes, a patient may have trapped air in their lungs (called auto-PEEP) from incomplete exhalation. In these cases, the lungs may already be at a higher pressure than normal between breaths, and using a pressure trigger can make it harder for the ventilator to detect when the patient is trying to inhale.
  - **Solution**: Use a **flow trigger** instead. Flow triggers work better in cases of auto-PEEP because they detect changes in airflow, not pressure. You can set the flow trigger to a threshold like **2 L/min**, allowing the ventilator to respond more sensitively to the patient’s effort.

### Key Differences:
- **Pressure Trigger**: Responds to changes in pressure (-2 cm H2O). Good for most patients but can be problematic with auto-PEEP.
- **Flow Trigger**: Responds to changes in airflow (e.g., 2 L/min). Useful when auto-PEEP is suspected, as it’s less affected by pressure changes already present in the lungs.

### Plateau pressure
- **Definition**: Plateau pressure is the pressure measured in the airway at the end of inspiration, when there is no airflow (i.e., at the end of a breath). It reflects the pressure needed to maintain inflation of the lungs during the inspiratory phase.
- **Measurement**: To measure Pplat, you typically use a ventilator that allows for a pause in airflow at the end of the inspiratory phase. The pressure is recorded while the ventilator is in a controlled state, with no active breathing.

### Importance of Plateau Pressure
1. **Assessment of Lung Compliance**:
   - Pplat can be used to assess lung compliance. Compliance is defined as the change in volume per change in pressure (C = ΔV/ΔP).
   - High plateau pressures can indicate low lung compliance (e.g., in conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia).

2. **Risk of Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI)**:
   - Elevated Pplat (generally >30 cm H2O) is associated with a higher risk of VILI, as it suggests that the lung is being overdistended or that there is significant resistance in the airways.

3. **Guiding Ventilator Settings**:
   - Monitoring Pplat helps in adjusting ventilator settings to avoid overdistension and ensure adequate ventilation without causing damage to the lungs.

### Calculation
- **Total Pressure**: The total pressure delivered to the airway consists of two components:
  - **Plateau Pressure (Pplat)**: Reflects lung compliance.
  - **Airway Resistance Pressure (Raw)**: Reflects resistance in the airway.

Using the equation:
\[ \text{Total Pressure} = \text{Pplat} + \text{(Airway Resistance x Flow Rate)} \]

### Clinical Considerations
- **Normal Range**: A normal plateau pressure is usually considered to be <30 cm H2O.
- **Action on Elevated Pplat**: If Pplat is elevated, clinicians may consider strategies such as:
  - Reducing tidal volume.
  - Increasing PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure) judiciously to improve oxygenation and avoid atelectasis.
  - Assessing for and treating underlying causes of decreased lung compliance.

Monitoring and understanding plateau pressure is vital for optimizing mechanical ventilation strategies and improving patient outcomes in critically ill patients.
