# SIMV/PSV mode

When SIMV/PSV mode is selected, the initial settings include the following:

- **Pressure support (PS)**: The pressure support typically ranges from <mark>5 to 15 cm H2O</mark> for spontaneous breaths initiated by the patient above the set rate. The pressure support can be adjusted as needed to maintain certain minute ventilation. 
- **Tidal volume (VT)**: The tidal volume is set similarly to VAC mode to achieve targeted minute ventilation without causing ventilator-associated lung injury (typically 4 to 8 mL/kg PBW) for the non-spontaneous breaths
