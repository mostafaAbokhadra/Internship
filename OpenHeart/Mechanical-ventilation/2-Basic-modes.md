### Basics

1. **Tidal Volume (VT)**: This is the amount of air you breathe in or out with each breath.

2. **Airway Pressure**: This is the pressure in your airways while air is moving in and out of your lungs.

3. **Compliance and Resistance**:
   - **Lung compliance** refers to how easily the lungs expand. If the lungs are "compliant," they stretch easily; if they are "stiff," they don't expand as easily.
   - **Airway resistance** refers to how easily air moves through the airways. Narrow or obstructed airways increase resistance, making it harder for air to flow.

4. **Modes of Mechanical Ventilation**: 
   - **VAC mode (Volume Assist-Control)**: In this mode, the amount of air (VT) is set to a fixed value. No matter what happens, the machine ensures a specific amount of air enters the lungs. If the lungs are stiff (low compliance), the pressure in the airways will increase to push the set volume of air in. If the lungs are more compliant (expand easily), less pressure is needed.

   ف هنا كمية الهوا اللي بتدخل ثابته احنا محددينها وال pressure بيتغير على حسب ال compliance بتاع ال lung 

   لو ال lung compliant وال patient بيدخله كمية الهوا على طول يبقى ال pressure اللي هحتاجه قليل

   لو مش compliant هحتاج pressure اعلى عشان ادخله كمية الهوا اللي انا محددها

   - **PAC mode (Pressure Assist-Control)**: Here, the pressure applied by the ventilator is fixed. Instead of guaranteeing a set volume, it guarantees a fixed pressure. If the lungs are compliant (expand easily), more air (VT) will enter. If the lungs are stiff (low compliance), less air enters. This means the volume of air (VT) varies depending on how easily the lungs expand.

### Key Points:
- In **VAC mode**, the air volume is fixed, but the pressure changes based on how easily the lungs expand.
- In **PAC mode**, the pressure is fixed, but the air volume changes based on lung compliance.

> - The selection of mechanical ventilation mode should be personalized to ensure safety by optimizing ventilation-perfusion matching and the pressure-volume relationship of the lungs. In addition, patient-ventilator synchrony and comfort are important factors for the mode selection.

### modes
- Mechanical ventilation can be administered through various modes, including mandatory or assisted modes.
- In the assisted mode, the patient's inspiratory effort triggers the mechanical ventilation to deliver the breath. At the same time, the pressure is the product of negative pleural pressure and positive alveolar pressure

- **The most common modes of mechanical ventilation include**:
    - Volume-limited assist control (VAC) ventilation
    - Pressure-limited assist control (PAC) ventilation 
    - Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) with pressure support ventilation (PSV)

Other types of mechanical ventilation modes include **controlled mechanical ventilation**, which can be volume-limited or pressure-limited, as well as **intermittent mandatory ventilation**. Additionally, **airway pressure release ventilation** (APRV: type of CPAP) or **bilevel** mechanical ventilation are less frequently used as initial settings.

> [!TIP]
> PSV is usually not used as a primary mode. instead, it is commonly used during the weaning process from mechanical ventilation

### MV cycle
#### Mechanical ventilation comprises 4 stages
- the trigger phase
- the inspiratory phase
- the cycling phase
- expiratory phase

The trigger phase initiates inhalation, either prompted by the patient's effort or predefined parameters set by the mechanical ventilator. The inspiratory phase involves the intake of air into the patient's lungs. Following inspiration, the cycling phase denotes the cessation of inhalation but precedes the onset of exhalation. Lastly, the expiratory phase signifies the passive exhalation of air from the patient's lungs.
