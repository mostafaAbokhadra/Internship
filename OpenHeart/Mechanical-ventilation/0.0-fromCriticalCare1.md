### objectives
- purpose of M.V
- indications
- criteria for institution of ventilatory support
- classifications of MV (-ve and +ve pressure and non invasive +ve)
- classification of +Ve pressure ventialtion (volum, pressure, time cycled(in pediatric))
- modes (CMV, A/C, SIMV, BIPAP, PC, HFV, PS, CPAP)
- peep and it's complications
- common vent settings(Fio2, VT, RR or f, I:E, Ve, sigh Volume, peak inspiratory pressure, trigger sensitivity)
- alarms causes and managements (low pressure, high pressure, decrease minute or tidal volume, increased minute or tidal volume, RR alarm, temperatrue alarm, vent inoperable, apnea alarm)
- complications of MV
    - Ventilator-Associated Lung Injury
    - Ventilator-Associated Events 
    - Hemodynamic Changes
    - atelect/baro/volu traumas
- lung protective strategy for ards
- vap bundel
- weaning criteria
- mehtods of weaning
- weaning criteria
- nursing care for MV patient
- role of nurse in weaning (before, during, after)

### notes from criticalCare1 book
- it's the last choise when ventilation can't be maintained by mehods like faceMask or cannula
- starts when RR > 35, VT < 5, vital capacity < 15, maximum inspiratory force < -20
- start when ph < 7.25, po2 < 60, pco2 > 50
- peep and cpap are used with refractroy hypoxemia e:g ARDS
- peak airway pressure shouldn't exceed 45cmH2o
- weaning criteria
    - awake and alert, po2 > 60, pco2 acceptable with normal ph, f < 25, VT 5ml/kg, vc > 10-15ml/kg, VE 5-10/min, NIF > -20cmH2o (indicates patient ability to take a deep breath and cough)
