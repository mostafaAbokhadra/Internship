### Intro
Mechanical ventilation is a critical intervention to sustain life in acute or emergent settings, particularly in patients with compromised airways, impaired ventilation, or hypoxemic respiratory failure. This procedure involves applying positive pressure breaths and relies on the airway system's compliance and resistance. 

### Indications
1. **Airway compromise due to disease**
    - trauma
    - oropharyngeal infection.
    - Patients with airway obstruction such as **angioedema** or distal issues (such as **asthmatic bronchospasm** or **acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease** or COPD).
2. Hypoventilation can result from impaired drive, pump failure, or gas exchange difficulties, leading to **hypercapnic respiratory failure**.
    - Impaired central drive (such as drug overdose)
    - Respiratory muscle weakness (such as muscular dystrophy and myositis)
    - Peripheral nervous system defects (such as Guillain-Barré syndrome or myasthenic crisis)
    - Restrictive ventilatory defects (such as chest wall trauma or disease or massive pneumothorax or effusion)
3. **Hypoxemic respiratory failure** may arise from the inability to effectively exchange oxygen or deliver it to peripheral tissues
    - Alveolar filling defects (such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or pulmonary edema)
    - Pulmonary vascular defects leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch (such as massive pulmonary embolism or air emboli)
    - Diffusion defects (such as advanced pulmonary fibrosis)
4. **Increased ventilatory demand**
    - severe sepsis, shock
    - severe metabolic acidosis

### Normal breating mechanics

1. **Muscle contraction**: The main muscle responsible for breathing is the **diaphragm**. When you breathe in, the diaphragm **contracts** and moves downward, increasing the space in your chest cavity.

2. **Pressure change**: As the chest cavity expands, the **pressure inside the lungs drops** because there's more room for the air to spread out. This drop in pressure makes the pressure inside the lungs **lower than the pressure outside the body (atmospheric pressure)**.

3. **Airflow into the lungs**: Air moves from areas of higher pressure (outside the body) to areas of lower pressure (inside the lungs), so air is **pulled into the lungs** through the nose or mouth to fill the lungs and equalize the pressure.

4. **Lung expansion**: As the air enters, the lungs expand to accommodate the incoming air, allowing oxygen to move into the bloodstream.

5. **Relaxation and exhalation**: Once the lungs are full, the diaphragm **relaxes** and moves back up, pushing air out of the lungs as the pressure increases.

> It’s like a bellows mechanism, where expanding the chest creates a suction that draws air in.
  
- **Mechanical ventilation**: On the other hand, during **controlled mechanical ventilation**, the ventilator applies **positive pressure** to the airways. This positive pressure forces air into the lungs, bypassing the need for the patient's inspiratory muscles to generate negative pleural pressure. The gas flow continues until a preset volume or pressure is reached, depending on the ventilation mode. 

In this setting, the lung's **compliance** (ability to stretch) and **airway resistance** (resistance to airflow) play a critical role in determining the effectiveness of the ventilation. Lower compliance (stiffer lungs) or higher resistance (narrowed airways) can reduce the efficiency of positive pressure ventilation, requiring adjustments in settings like tidal volume, pressure, or respiratory rate.
