### arterial line
- Arterial lines may be inserted into various arteries, with the <mark>radial and femoral</mark> arteries being commonly preferred due to their accessibility. Alternatively, arterial lines can be placed in the brachial artery, the dorsalis pedis artery, or the ulnar artery.
- Palpation or ultrasound can aid in locating the artery accurately
- Before arterial catheterization, confirming the presence of collateral circulation to the affected area is crucial, ensuring peripheral circulation is maintained by an alternate artery in case of disruption in the cannulated artery. The Allen test, performed at the wrist, is one such method to assess collateral flow in the hand.

### indications
- it is a routine and standard procedure in intensive care settings, emergency rooms, and the operating room. 
- it facilitate a one-time or frequent arterial blood sampling to assess oxygenation and acid-base status, as well as for hemodynamic monitoring through the evaluation of various patterns of arterial waveforms.
- In cases of hypoxemic respiratory failure, arterial lines enable the calculation of the oxygenation index (OI), a crucial metric for assessing lung disease severity. OI is computed as mean airway pressure divided by the product of arterial oxygen partial pressure and fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2). An OI exceeding 8 indicates moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while an OI surpassing 16 signifies severe ARDS.
- cardiac and radiological interventions, manual or automated exchange transfusions, plasmapheresis, continuous arterio-venous perfusion, hemodialysis, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> arterial lines should never be used for medication administration, as doing so can result in severe complications, including <mark>paresthesias, intense pain, motor dysfunction, compartment syndrome, gangrene, and limb loss</mark>

### contraindications

#### absolute
- Peripheral or distal arterial insufficiency
- Peripheral arterial vascular diseases, including the small-to-medium vasculitides

### The Allen Test

The Allen test is traditionally performed before catheterization of the radial artery. This test ensures sufficient collateral ulnar arterial blood flow to avoid distal ischemic injury. To perform this test, the radial and ulnar pulses are simultaneously occluded by manual palpation for 10 to 15 seconds or until blanching of the palm is noted. Then, the ulnar arterial occlusion is released. If the blanching resolves quickly, the patency of the ulnar artery is enough to perfuse the hand despite a complete or partial occlusion of the radial artery.

As arteries have a vital role in supplying oxygenated blood, it is important to make sure there is a collateral circulation to the area of the body that is supplied by the chosen artery. This is necessary in case an arterial thrombosis (blood clot) occurs, as adequate peripheral circulation to the limb by another artery is essential to avoid permanent limb damage.

### Securing the Arterial Catheter

Following the successful placement of the catheter and establishment of a connection to the transducer apparatus, the procedural team must ensure the catheter's secure fixation. This precautionary measure aims to prevent inadvertent dislodgement, reduce the risk of infection, and minimize excessive motion around the adjacent joint, which could potentially interfere with precise monitoring. This procedure serves the dual purpose of safeguarding the catheter and extending its longevity, thereby obviating the need for a repeat intervention. Transparent adhesive dressings are the preferred choice, allowing for direct visualization of the insertion site.

If the wrist is the site of insertion, if possible, the hand is kept slightly extended and immobilized with a soft roll fixated between the dorsum of the wrist and a rigid board where the hand and forearm will be affixed. The connection tubing takes a loop around the thumb and undergoes a second securement to the forearm. To obtain an accurate blood pressure reading, the monitoring device must be set to "zero" while the transducer hub is leveled at the height of the atrium

### Arterial Catheter Monitoring

The accuracy of data obtained from arterial catheterization is contingent upon the transducer's precise positioning and the monitoring system's effective dampening. Establishing the correct system configuration to measure arterial blood pressure accurately is crucial. For patients in a prone position, the transducer is typically placed at the level of the right atrium or the midaxillary line in the fourth intercostal space. Conversely, for seated patients, considering the lower cerebral pressure compared to the heart level, the transducer should be positioned at the level of the brain. Proper transducer alignment minimizes hydrostatic pressure's impact, ensuring measurement accuracy. Additionally, specific steps must be meticulously followed to guarantee precise readings. They are as follows:

Prepare a 500 ml bag of normal saline without heparin, spike it with the transducer administration set, and meticulously remove all air from the tubing, paying close attention to the transducer and flush port.

Introduction
Arterial lines are commonly used in patients who are critically ill to monitor arterial blood pressure continuously, and to obtain blood samples for arterial blood gases and blood specimen collection. The radial artery is the most common site for arterial line insertion, but other arteries may be used, including the ulnar, brachial, femoral or dorsalis pedis.

As arteries have a vital role in supplying oxygenated blood, it is important to make sure there is a collateral circulation to the area of the body that is supplied by the chosen artery. This is necessary in case an arterial thrombosis (blood clot) occurs, as adequate peripheral circulation to the limb by another artery is essential to avoid permanent limb damage.

Professional skill
It is important that the health professional who inserts the arterial line is competent in this skill. Arterial lines should only be used in clinical areas where staff have the competency to care for them safely; they are not appropriate for use on general wards (Garretson, 2005). Nurses should only take on care of an arterial line when they have:

Undergone training;
Been assessed as competent to do so.
They should follow local policies and procedures and work in adherence with the Nursing and Midwifery Council’s (2018) code of conduct.

Setting up the transducer system
The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland’s (2014) guideline for arterial lines aims to reduce harm to patients from administration of the incorrect infusion fluid, and to identify steps that should be taken to reduce this risk.

Arterial lines should be clearly identifiable following local procedures, as this will reduce the risk to patients of accidental drug administration into the artery. Registered health professionals should check the infusion solution (usually 500ml of 0.9% sodium chloride) before connecting to a patient, and also at all patient handovers, such as transfer from the emergency department to critical care or shift handovers in the critical care unit (Leslie et al, 2013).

The infusate fluid and arterial line transducer set should be changed according to local policies and procedures. The infusate is contained in a pressure bag, which is inflated to 300mmHg; as this pressure is higher than the arterial systolic pressure, it prevents the backflow of blood from the cannula into the administration set.

Pressurize the bag to 300 mmHg and set it at a flow rate of 1 to 3 ml/hr, as the elevated pressure counteracts systemic arterial pressure, preventing blood contamination of the transducer. Subsequently, invert the bag and fast flush to eliminate any remaining air bubbles.

Connect the transducer to the monitor and conduct a square wave test by fast-flushing the line to observe changes in the waveform.

Zero the transducer and monitor, close the line off to the patient, open it to air, and press the "zero" button on the monitor.

Before monitoring pressure, close the port to the air and open it to the patient. Connect the patient's catheter and flush it to clear any blood.

Check the monitor for a good arterial waveform with prominently displayed arterial blood pressure and mean values.
In addition to ensuring the proper positioning of the transducer, it's essential to consider the influence of dampening on the monitoring system. Dampening can lead to inaccurate systolic and diastolic pressure readings, which become evident in the arterial line waveforms.

For instance, if the transducer is situated too low in relation to the catheter, it results in abnormally elevated pressure values. Conversely, the pressure data may be unusually low if the transducer is placed too high relative to the catheter.

To evaluate and address dampening issues, a square wave test is frequently employed for interpretation. This test involves a rapid saline flush, creating elevated pressure and generating vibrations in the transducer. The speed at which these oscillations cease, referred to as the dampening coefficient, is carefully assessed.

One typically observes 1 to 2 oscillations in a standard square wave test. However, if the arterial line exhibits inadequate dampening, multiple oscillations persist following the fast saline flush, leading to an underestimation of diastolic pressure and an overestimation of systolic pressure.

However, when the arterial line is overdampened, no oscillations occur after the fast saline flush. While this results in an accurate diastolic pressure reading, it may falsely depict a lower systolic pressure. It's worth noting that an overdampened system can also be caused by a clot or fibrin in the catheter tip

### complications

encompass pain, bruising, hematoma formation, thrombosis, pseudoaneurysm formation, vasospasm, dissection, AV fistula formation, air embolism, and particulate embolism.

Vasospasm, identified in up to 57% of patients in some older reports, presents with symptoms such as pain, decreased blood pressure, waveform dampening, blanching of the fingers or hand, or loss of pulse or O2 saturation signal in the affected limb

catheter-related infection and inflammation are the most prevalent (61.8%) followed by mechanical issues (14.1%), embolic or thrombotic events (7.5%), and amputation due to ischemic injury (0.6%)

Higher complication rates are associated with critical illness, cardiac surgery, bone marrow transplantation, and hemodialysis

Thrombus formation in the cannula;
Distal ischaemia to the cannula;
Haemorrhage from the monitoring system;
Infection;
Air embolism;
Use of wrong infusate fluid;
Inadvertent injection of drugs into the cannula.

Drugs that are wrongly injected into an arterial line will result in that drug being directed to the limbs and body extremities. This leads to the injected particles lodging in blood capillaries and affecting circulation, which can result in a lack of blood flow, eventually causing the tissue to die. If not identified early, vascular complications can cause permanent harm to patients and may result in limb amputations

Patients with radial arterial cannulas must be closely observed to monitor thumb and hand perfusion. Arterial cannulation can cause distal ischemia to the arterial cannula if a patient’s blood supply is compromised. The nurse must be vigilant in observing for changes in skin temperature and colour, and for patients complaining of limb pain.

Monitoring is important to make sure there is no haemorrhage from the arterial pressure monitoring system or from the insertion site.

### Nursing

Maintaining catheter patency is of utmost importance, achieved through continuous infusion at a rate of 1 to 3 mL/hour, either with or without a pressurized bag system. Commonly employed infusate fluids include normal saline or normal saline with 1 to 2 units/mL of heparin. Studies have indicated that using heparinized solutions does not diminish the risk of catheter thrombosis.

Consequently, when drawing blood from the arterial line for laboratory analysis, discarding an initial portion of the blood is imperative to prevent potential laboratory errors. Typically, a waste of 1 to 3 mL suffices, the specific amount dependent on the patient's age and circulating blood volume

Historical accounts of hyperglycemia have been linked to the infusion of glucose-containing fluids through arterial lines. Moreover, reports of limb ischemia and skin and tissue necrosis resulting from inadvertent medication infusion through arterial catheters emphasize the need for rigorous precautions. Proper labeling of the arterial line is essential to avoid these complications, with the added safeguard of dual nursing verification for infusing fluids.

Regular monitoring of perfusion distal to the catheter is assigned to nursing staff. If any concerns arise regarding ongoing perfusion impairment, prompt catheter removal is warranted to avert potential complications.

The arterial administration set delivers a continuous slow flush of 3-4ml per hour; this keeps the line free from clots. It is important that this infusate solution is continuous – it should not be discontinued.

Monitoring using an arterial line
Arterial lines are used to monitor arterial blood pressure continuously, so it is essential to understand normal and abnormal arterial pressure waveforms; these are shown in Fig 1.

Arterial pressure waveforms are obtained by attaching the arterial line to a transducer (Fig 2). A transducer is a device that converts one energy form to another – in this case, it converts pressure into an electrical signal. This signal is sent via a cable to a monitor, where it is displayed as a waveform. The arterial line waveform can be affected by anatomical, physiological and technical factors. Accuracy of arterial blood pressure monitoring relies on the patient exhibiting a normal arterial pressure waveform and the nurse recognising this. When monitoring blood pressure via an arterial line, the transducer needs to be placed at the level of the heart. This position is known as the phlebostatic axis and is located at the fourth intercostal space on the mid-axillary line

### arterial line connection
![](https://cdn.ps.emap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Fig-2.-Arterial-line-connection-1024x731.jpg)

Overdamped waves, which underestimate blood pressure, can be a result of air bubbles or clots in the pressure tubing, kinks in the catheter or tubing, low pressure in the pressure bag, or no fluid in the flush bag. Underdamped waves overestimate blood pressure and can be caused by an artefact, stiff non-compliant tubing, hypothermia, tachycardia or dysrhythmia.

A scale is used when the arterial pressure waveform is displayed on the monitor. This scale can be altered depending on the patient’s blood-pressure measurements. Normal waves can appear overdamped or underdamped if the arterial waveform is not scaled properly. Most monitors contain an auto-scale feature. It is important to check this if there are concerns about the arterial waveform, and adjust it as required. Blood pressure changes can mean the scale is no longer correct and should be readjusted.

Accurate monitoring of arterial blood pressure requires the transducer to be ‘zeroed’:

At least once during each shift;
When the accuracy of the reading is in doubt.
Zeroing is performed to counteract the influence of external pressures, such as atmospheric pressure, on the monitoring system. Zeroing the transducer ensures that only the arterial pressure will be measured so the arterial blood-pressure readings will be accurate. There are a number of steps required to perform this and it is important to follow local guidelines to ensure patient safety and infection control.

When a patient is moved, care needs to be taken to make sure the transducer remains positioned correctly at the phlebostatic axis; it may need repositioning and it is important to consider whether the transducer should be re-zeroed.

The position of the arterial cannula in the artery can affect blood pressure; for example, a cannula in the radial artery may have been affected by the position of a patient’s wrist. As such, it is important to make sure the waveform is normal (Fig 1) before making any alterations to the patient’s treatment, such as increasing or decreasing medications that will alter their blood pressure.

Blood sampling via an arterial line should only be performed after training, supervised practice and successful competency assessment, as per local policy. Using a correct sampling technique is fundamental to making sure the blood sample is not contaminated with the infusate, which may affect all blood results, including arterial blood gases, clotting studies and electrolytes (AAGBI, 2014). To eliminate this, the nurse or health professional must withdraw and discard a volume of three times the dead space of the arterial line (Leslie et al, 2013). Care must be taken to ensure:

All caps in the arterial line system are closed and connected;
Lines are flushed thoroughly after sampling;
When flushing lines, it is not forced, as there may be a thrombus that, if dislodged, may lead to ischemia.
This ensures patient safety before and after the procedure. Making sure the pressure bag is maintained at 300mmHg will mean there is a counter-pressure to prevent thrombus formation.

Obtaining the blood sample is the initial stage; the sample must then be processed in line with local policies and procedures. When the results are available, they must be analysed by a health professional who is competent to do so and can make clinical decisions about the care of a patient who is critically ill. Any concerns about obtaining arterial blood samples or any of the blood results must be reported to the nurse in charge of the patient.

### arterial line care

Arterial lines must be secured in line with local policy and covered with a clear dressing, with the date of dressing change clearly documented

When changing the dressing, all local infection prevention and control techniques – such as aseptic non-touch technique – should be followed. The skin should be wiped away from the insertion site and allowed to air dry

**documente:**

A clean, intact dressing;
Documenting the date of dressing changes;
Observing the insertion site for phlebitis.

Once the arterial cannula is removed, direct pressure must be applied to the insertion site until haemostasis (formation of a clot to limit bleeding from the insertion site) is fully achieved; this may take up to 15 minutes, depending on the position of the arterial line and the patient’s coagulation status. If there are any concerns about line removal, it is essential to ask the nurse in charge of the patient for help.
