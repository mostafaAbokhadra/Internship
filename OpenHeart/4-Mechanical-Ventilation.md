### Intro
Mechanical ventilation is a critical intervention to sustain life in acute or emergent settings, particularly in patients with compromised airways, impaired ventilation, or hypoxemic respiratory failure. This procedure involves applying positive pressure breaths and relies on the airway system's compliance and resistance. Clinicians in critical care units must understand how mechanical ventilation affects patient physiology and response to various disease states, emphasizing the need for a deep understanding of safe application principles.

### Indications
1. Airway compromise due to disease 
    - trauma
    - oropharyngeal infection.
    - Patients with airway obstruction such as angioedema or distal issues (such as asthmatic bronchospasm or acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD).
2. Hypoventilation can result from impaired drive, pump failure, or gas exchange difficulties, leading to hypercapnic respiratory failure.
    - Impaired central drive (such as drug overdose)
    - Respiratory muscle weakness (such as muscular dystrophy and myositis)
    - Peripheral nervous system defects (such as Guillain-Barr√© syndrome or myasthenic crisis)
    - Restrictive ventilatory defects (such as chest wall trauma or disease or massive pneumothorax or effusion)
3. Hypoxemic respiratory failure may arise from the inability to effectively exchange oxygen or deliver it to peripheral tissues
    - Alveolar filling defects (such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or pulmonary edema)
    - Pulmonary vascular defects leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch (such as massive pulmonary embolism or air emboli)
    - Diffusion defects (such as advanced pulmonary fibrosis)
4. Increased ventilatory demand
    - severe sepsis, shock
    - severe metabolic acidosis
