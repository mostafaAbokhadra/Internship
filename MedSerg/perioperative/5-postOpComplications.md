# post-op complications

> [!IMPORTANT]
> prevention and early detection of complications and quick management if any of them occur is the nurse's role

### immediate Complications

1. **primary hemorrhage**: starts during surgery
2. **reactionary hemorrhage**: due to high blood pressure post operatively
3. **atelectasis**
4. **shock**: blood loss, acute MI, Pulmonary embolism, speticemia
5. **low urine output**: inadequate fluid replacement intra-op and post-op

### general complication

1. **pain**: due to tissue trauma and surgical incision
    - assess pain regularlyl
    - non-pharmacological pain management
    - offer analgesia around the clock
2. **Acute confusion**:
    - do ICDSC, CAM-ICU, GCS, RAAS regularly
    - treat any cause
    - treat pain and sleep disturbance
    - communicate with the patient and orient him regularly
3. **Nausea and vomiting**:
    - NPO until assessing cause
    - NGT, fluid and E<sup>+-<sup> replacement
    - antiemetic

### specific post-Op complications

1. **fever**:
    - **Days <mark>0-2</mark>**
        1. **Mild fever** <mark><38</mark> (common)
        2. **persistent fever** <mark>> 38</mark>
            - lung infection
            - specific infection related to surgery
    - **Days 3-5** the fever may be due to 
        1. pneumonia and spesis
        2. wound infection and abscess formation
        3. phlebitie and DVT
    - **after 5 days**
        - complications related to surgery
2. **Hemorrhage** (hypovolemic shock)
    1. **external** in surgical site
    2. **internal**
3. **infection**
    1. **wound infection** occuring within <mark>first week</mark> present as <mark>pain, redness, swelling, warmth purulent discharge, increase in temperature and pulse</mark>, examine wound drainage
    2. **cellulities and abscesses**
4. **disordered wound healing**
5. **Wound dehiscence or wound disruption**: partial-to-complete separation of the wound edges.
6. **Wound Evisceration**: protrusion of the abdominal viscera
through the incision and onto the abdominal wall.

#### **Manage by**
- Notify the surgeon at once
- Position the client to low Fowler’s position
- Instruct the client not to cough, sneeze, eat or drink, and remain quiet until the surgeon arrives
- Protruding viscera should be covered with sterile dressing moisten with sterile normal saline.

7. **atelectasis**:
    - Prevention is by pre-operative and postoperative physiotherapy.
    - In severe cases, positive pressure ventilation may be required.
8. **aspiration pneumonitis**
    - prevent by oral antacids or metoclopramide.
    - USE VAP bundle item
    - don't start feeding until hearing bowel sound and start gradually
    - bronchial suction, positive pressure ventilation, prophylactic antibiotics and IV steroids for severe cases
9. **acute respiratory distress syndrome**
    - MV and PEEP
10. **Thromboembolism**
    - **monitor signs of DVT**: swelling of the leg, tenderness of the calf muscle and increased warmth with calf pain on passive dorsiflexion of the foot(positive Homan’s sign), do venography or Doppler ultrasound.
    - **monitor signs of Pulmonary embolism**: sudden dyspnea and cardiovascular collapse with pleuritic chest pain, pleural rub and hemoptysis. However, smaller pulmonary emboli are more common and present with confusion, breathlessness and chest pain, do ventilation/perfusion scanning and/or pulmonary angiography or dynamic CT.

### nursing management of thromboembolism

- **Prevention of thrombus formation via**:
    - Adequate administration of fluid after operation
    - Early ambulation postoperatively
    - Leg exercises
    - Avoid the pillow-roll or any form of elevation that will cause constriction under the knee
- **Active treatment**
    - Anticoagulant therapy
    - Bed rest and elevation of affected limb
    - pplication of elastic compression stockings to prevent swelling and stagnation of venous blood in the legs.

11. **urinary retention and UTI and AKI**
12. **Paralytic Ileus**
