4. ### Platelets
- bone marrow failure
- thrombocytopenia to treat hemorrhage
- leukemia and chemotherapy
5. ### Cryoprecipitate (anti hemophilic factor)
- hemophilia
- severe liver disease
- fibrinogen < 1.5

### Nursing

1. **before** 
- assess readiness and take permission and informed consent
- blood sample drawing and send to lab for ABO, RH, virology
- physician order: type of blood component, amount, timing (2-4hrs) choose higher period for renal and cardiac patients
- check labs for purpose of transfusion
- assess conditions that increase risk of overload (heart and kidney diseases)
- previous blood transfusion history, complications
- verify patent venous access
- v/s: stable it before transfusion, don't transfuse until within normal range
- assess any pre-existing signs and symptoms e:g dyspnea, rashes, pruritis, wheezing or chills	
- read blood unit label and check expiration date, discoloration, presence of clots, any signs of leakage, blood group, RH and compare with patient chart

2. **procedure**
- rub your hand and gather equipment
- third check with other HCP
> [!TIP]
> - transfusion set drop factor is 10drop/min
> - don't expose blood unit to sun when transferred between hospitals, but in ice pack
> - to warm frozen blood component put it in a plastic bag upright in a warm basin and administer within 30 min otherwise return it back to blood bank 

3. **During**
- identify p.t and explain procedure and assess readiness
- voiding before
- v/s again immediately before initiation
- invert unit gently up and down
- disinfect line port
- initiate NS before blood
- start slowly no faster than 20 drop/min for first 15 min and closely monitor the patient
- adjust flow rate after the 15 minutes if no reaction happened:
>[!NOTE]
> flow rate = `amount * drop factor (10) * time in minutes`
- **monitor reaction signs**:
- itching, hives, swelling, dyspnea, fever, headache, flank pain, chills, if happend do:
	- stop transfusion
	- keep iv line open with NS only
	- v/s
	- notify physician
- **dispose equipment and hand rub**
- **documentation**:
- type and volume and infusion rate
- date and time of initiation and completion
- any administered medications
- vascular access device used (e:g r.t cannula)
- v/s before initiation and after 15 min and after 2 hours and at the end
- response or any adverse reaction
**example**\
1 unit of whole blood through r.t peripheral line 16drop/min , v/s before ....., v/s after 15 min ... , v/s after 2 hrs, v/s at the end, no reaction occur

### Nursing consideration
- don't use blood transfusion line to inject medications
- don't heat unit using microwave or hot water
- don't administer rapidly before warming -> dysrhythmias
- if patient need multiple transfusion you can use blood warmer device
- complete transfusion within 4 hrs maximum

###  transfusion reactions

1. **hemolytic reaction (immunological)**
- within 15 min of initiation
- manifestation include <mark>hypotension, tachycardia and tachypnea, fever and chills, facial flushing, hemoglobinuria, chest or flank pain, hemoglobinuria</mark>
- hemolysis release free hemoglobin into the plasma -> kidney try to filter that causing hemoglobinuria -> hemoglobin will obstruct renal tubules -> acute renal failure
- **action**:
	- stop transfusion immediately and notify physician
	- maintain line and continue NS only

2. **Febrile reaction**
- fever within 2hrs after initiation, chills, headache and malaise
- **action**\
	- stop transfusion immediately and notify physician
	- maintain line and continue NS only
	- manage fever by paracetamol and continue transfusion according to patient order

3. **allergic reaction**
- transient flushing and urticaria (mild)
- anaphylactic shock (severe) signs and symptoms include respiratory symptoms and circulatory collapse
- stop transfusion, give antihistamine (e:g ampule avil im) for mild and may continue transfusion according to physician order, if severe give epinephrine and steroids(dexamethasone)

4. **delayed hemolysis** (health teaching)
	1. within 3-10 days
	2. fever, anemia, high bilirubin and jaundice
	3. mild and require no further intervention
	
5. **transfusion transmitted infection**
- prevent by accutate virology test
