# care of mechanically ventilated patients

### initial safety checks
- observe patient, tube and MV and circuit
- chest rising and falling, auscultate air entry, fixation of tube, patient color, v/s esp. pulse and BP, LOC fluctuate -> may be hypoxic -> do suction
- fast access to MRB, suction unit and catheters, intubation equipments (if in case of exutabation occur esp. in risky patient e:g agitated)
- adjust MV setting e:i alarm limits e:g when HR exceeds 110

### Routine care of MV patients
- patient and family
- tube
- MV itself

### for patient and family
- **assess** from head to toe, focus on respiratory and circulatory
- **oral care** -> to prevent pnuemonia (VAP)
- **eye care** -> blinking refelexes are impaired due to low LOC , close his eyes after care becaues it's sensetive to bacteria and infection
- **nutrition** esp. proteins, becarful of high carbs because it produce CO2, ensure enough water intake to prevent dryness
- **skin care**: prevent pressure ulcers, sedation also cause immobility :)
positioning unitll contraindicated, air matress, moisture the skin using creams
- sleep promotion, decrease interruption of sleep for interventions
- **communication** board contains common ADLS tasks so patinet can point to it and you do it for him
-**pain management**: continuous assessment using NON verbal pain scale, consider complaint and consult doctor for analgesics
chest pain can hinder patient from breathing normally
- **family care**: teaching about MV, weaning and it's consequences, usually MV is disconnected after 8 hours from surgeries


## trouble shooting

when troubleshooting think
1. machine
2. patient
3. tube

- call for help
- disconnect patient from MV
- hyperventilation 100% MRB
- if pateint still uncompartable consider patient problems not machine
- patency of tube: is it obstructed? does the suction insert to the end ?
- ABG
- X-ray -> pnuemothorax or tension..

# vent alarms

1. ### MV inoperative
- ventilator is not woking so manually ventilate patient untill new ventilator is set up or some one is troubleshooting it

2. ### low pressure alarm
- patient is leaking some inspired air
**assess all of the following**
- something is disconnected? airflow is inadequate? ETT cuff leak? so manually ventialte patient untill leaking is resolved

3. ### high pressure alarm
- pip reached limt
- something is obstructed
- secretions, bitting tube? water accumulate in circuit? decrese lung compliance e:g ARDS and pulmonary edema? 

4. ### apnea alarm
- occurs in spantaneous modes e:g cpap
- patient doesn't take breating spantaneously
- encourage pateint to breath

5. ### increased minute or tidal volume
- patient is breating more spantaneously breathing
- hypoxia
- increased lung compliance

6. ### change in RR
- hypoxia or hypercarbia
- increased metabolic demand
- obtain ABG

### complicatoin of MV
1. patient ventilator dyssynchrony
    - patient is fighting the MV
        - comfort patient, put on sedation
        - consider changing mode as appropriate
2. MV induced lung injury
    - barotrauma
        - due to high pressure
    - volutrauma
        - due to high tidal volume
    - atelectrauma
        - due to repeating opening and closing of alveoli (shearing forces)
    - biotrauma
    it can lead to ARDS
<mark>NOTE: revise ARDS</mark>

### Vap
- vap occur after 48-72 hrs of itubation
**bundle**
- elevate head of bed 30-45 degree
- daily sedation vacation to assess readiness to wean
- oral hygeine with or without (chlorhexidine) 12% with or without toothburshing
- hand hygeine prior to touching any ventrilator tubing or patient mouth
- subglotic aspiration
- cuff pressure maintaince
- pressure ulcer prophylaxis (prevent aspiration of acid)
- DVT propylaxis
prevent tube obstruction


4. Cardio compormis
- hight PPV -> compress heart -> decrease CO, and venous return, decrease BP and pulmonary edema
increase ICP due to backward pressure

5. hepatic and renal dysfunction
due to cardiac compression and decrease blood flow to these organs
6. GIT 
 - inflation and abdominal distension -> decrease lung capacity -> NGT to decompress air -> prevent by maintaining cuff inflation
- sedation and immobiliy -> constipation -> enema


# questions
1. what from the following indicates the need of suction?
<mark>visible secretion in tube</mark>

2. complications of high PEEP > 5 ? <mark>Hypotension</mark>

3. high pressure alarm can be caused by? 
<mark>increse secretion in airway, bit block, kinnked tubes</mark>

4. how to prevent VAP?
<mark>12% chlorohexidine gluconate (hexitol)</mark>
NOTE: for skin care use concentration of 2%
oral suction as needed

5. MV patient should avoid diet high in ?
<mark>carbs</mark>

### preparation (out of book)
- assessment of MV equipments and supplies
    - must be ready in the moment it is needed
    - regularly review the number, function and sterility of consumable supplies such as single-use circuits, humidifier chambers, suction materials and end tidal CO2 (EtCO2) cuvettes
    - Assigning an individual staff member to maintain the ventilator(s) is important
    - a system to review, order, and organize this inventory
- bed side ventilatro cart
- Bag-Valve Mask for emergency ventilation
- Sterile endotracheal tubes
- Laryngoscope
- Tube ties
- ET cuff manometer
- Replacement tracheostomy tubes/liners
- Suction supplies -airway and oral separated

### monitoring
- At minimum, an electrocardiograph (ECG), capnography (EtCO2), and pulse oximeter (SpO2), invasive and/or oscillometric blood pressure should be monitored on any mechanically ventilated patient 
- monitor driving pressures, transpulmonary pressures, and pressure-volume loops to ensure appropriate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and prevent excess distending pressure
- auscultate lung sounds, diminished lung sounds, and changes in heart sounds or rhythm
